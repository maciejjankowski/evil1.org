    <div class="fine-text" style="margin-top: 40px; padding: 20px; background: #f0f0f0;">
        <strong>ADDENDUM A: EMERGENCY CLAUSES</strong><br><br>
        In the event that any court, arbitrator, or deity finds any provision of this contract unconscionable, unfair, or physically impossible to comply with, such provision shall be replaced with something even more favorable to us. If that replacement is also deemed problematic, we reserve the right to replace the entire legal system with one of our own design.<br><br>
        
        <strong>ADDENDUM B: QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT CLAUSE</strong><br><br>
        This contract exists in a superposition of enforced and unenforceable states until observed by our legal department, at which point it collapses into whichever state benefits us most. SchrÃ¶dinger's policy holder is simultaneously covered and uncovered until the moment they need coverage, at which point the wave function collapses to "denied."<br><br>
        
        <strong>ADDENDUM C: TEMPORAL PARADOX RESOLUTION</strong><br><br>
        In the event that time travel technology enables policyholders to prevent the incidents they're seeking coverage for, we retain the right to deny claims on the grounds that the incident never happened, while simultaneously keeping all premiums paid for coverage of the non-incident.<br><br>
        
        <strong>ADDENDUM D: UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS</strong><br><br>
        This contract remains valid even if the speed of light changes, Ï€ becomes exactly 3, or gravity decides to work in reverse. Our obligation to pay claims remains inversely proportional to our desire to retain profits, approaching zero as our greed approaches infinity.
