                In 2023, Meta (Facebook) laid off over 11,000 employees in a single day, instantly boosting its stock price and 'delivering value' to shareholders. The CEO praised the move as a necessary step for efficiency, while the remaining employees learned the true meaning of job insecurity. This is just one example of how corporations prioritize shareholder returns over human lives.

            <div class="teaser-article-content">
                In 2017, Uber was sued by Waymo for allegedly stealing self-driving car secrets. Shareholder value: up, ethics: down. This case reveals the lengths corporations will go to maintain their competitive edge, including industrial espionage, sabotage, and outright theft of intellectual property. The revolving door between government and industry only makes it easier.

            <div class="teaser-article-content">
                Goldman Sachs lures top talent with multi-million dollar bonuses, but only if they stay chained to their desks for 80+ hours a week. Shareholders rejoice as human capital is maximally extracted. This compensation strategy creates a gilded cage where high pay comes at the cost of personal freedom, family life, and mental health. The ultimate corporate loyalty test.

            <div class="teaser-article-content">
                The 2025 ICE raid at Hyundai's Georgia plant revealed hundreds of undocumented workers. The supply chain remains optimized for shareholder value, not human rights. From sweatshops in Bangladesh to forced labor in Xinjiang, modern slavery is the dark underbelly of global capitalism. Corporations claim ignorance while their profits fund oppression worldwide.

            <div class="teaser-article-content">
                Profile the most spectacular whistleblower failures—where honesty backfired. JPMorgan enabled Jeffrey Epstein's crimes for years, ignoring internal warnings to protect a lucrative client. Shareholder value > ethics. These stories reveal how corporations systematically destroy those who dare to speak truth to power, turning heroes into pariahs.

            <div class="teaser-article-content">
                After Hurricane Maria, hedge funds bought up Puerto Rican debt, squeezing the island for profit while shareholders toasted their good fortune. This is vulture capitalism at its worst—profiting from human suffering and natural disasters. The financialization of everything turns tragedy into opportunity for those with enough capital to bet against humanity.
