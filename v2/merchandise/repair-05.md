# I Can Fix It (If You Let Me)

*The battle cry of the technically competent but legally constrained*

## Product Details

**Type:** Weatherproof Sticker  
**Price:** $5.99  
**Size:** 3" x 2" (7.6cm x 5cm)  
**Text:** "I Can Fix It (If You Let Me)"  
**Subtext:** "Right to Repair = Right to Own"  

Perfect for laptops, toolboxes, and repair benches. Weatherproof defiance that lasts as long as your frustration with anti-repair policies.

## The Right to Repair Movement

This sticker represents a simple but radical idea: **If you buy something, you should be allowed to fix it.**

### What We're Fighting For:

- **Access to Repair Manuals:** Documentation shouldn't be classified information
- **Availability of Parts:** Replacement components at reasonable prices
- **Independent Repair Shops:** Competition to manufacturer monopolies
- **Software Freedom:** No more serialized parts or firmware locks

### What We're Fighting Against:

- **Design for Disposal:** Products built to break and be replaced
- **Repair Monopolies:** "Only we can fix what we made"
- **Legal Intimidation:** DMCA takedowns on repair tutorials
- **Economic Extortion:** $800 repairs for $20 problems

## Why This Matters

**Environmental Impact:**
- E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally
- Extending device lifespans by just 1 year would save millions of tons of CO2
- Repair uses 90% less energy than manufacturing new

**Economic Impact:**
- Independent repair creates local jobs
- Competition drives down repair costs
- Consumer savings average 40-60% vs. manufacturer repair

**Social Impact:**
- Technical literacy and self-reliance
- Local economic development
- Reduced dependence on monopolistic corporations

## Real-World Examples

**John Deere Tractors:** Farmers can't fix their own equipment without dealer approval  
**Tesla Vehicles:** Simple repairs require proprietary parts and software authorization  
**Apple Devices:** Serialized components won't work even if they're genuine Apple parts  
**Medical Devices:** Hospitals can't repair life-saving equipment during emergencies  

## The Gentle Sarcasm

The parenthetical "(If You Let Me)" captures the absurdity of needing permission to fix things you own. It's a polite way of saying:

- "I have the skills, tools, and parts, but your lawyers say no"
- "My competence is limited by your business model"
- "I could fix this in 5 minutes if you'd stop preventing me"

## Placement Suggestions

**Laptop Lid:** Visible during meetings about digital rights  
**Toolbox:** Solidarity with other repair enthusiasts  
**Car Window:** Mobile advocacy for automotive right to repair  
**Workbench:** Inspiration during frustrated repair attempts  
**Phone Case:** Ironic placement on devices you can't actually repair  

## What Your Purchase Supports

- **Legal Advocacy:** Funding right to repair legislation
- **Educational Resources:** Teaching repair skills and consumer rights
- **Independent Repair Networks:** Supporting local repair shops
- **Investigative Journalism:** Exposing anti-repair corporate practices
