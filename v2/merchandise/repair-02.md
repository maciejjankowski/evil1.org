# Pentalobe or Die

*The ultimate tribute to Apple's screw-you approach to repair*

## Product Details

**Type:** T-Shirt  
**Price:** $29.99  
**Front:** "Pentalobe or Die"  
**Back:** "Innovation Through Obstruction"  

Available in sizes S-3XL, featuring Apple's signature commitment to making simple repairs impossible through the magic of proprietary fasteners.

## The Pentalobe Story

In 2009, Apple introduced the Pentalobe screw to the world—a five-pointed star-shaped fastener specifically designed to prevent users from opening their own devices. Because nothing says "Think Different" like making sure only Apple can think about your hardware.

### Key Features of Apple's Screw Strategy:

- **Uniqueness:** Can't find a Pentalobe screwdriver at your local hardware store
- **Control:** Forces customers to visit Apple stores for simple repairs
- **Profit:** Turns $2 screws into $200 service calls
- **Innovation:** Revolutionary approach to customer hostility

## Why This T-Shirt Matters

This shirt celebrates the beautiful irony of a company that:
- Preaches environmental responsibility while making devices harder to repair
- Claims to value user empowerment while literally screwing them over
- Sells $5 screwdrivers for screws that shouldn't exist

## The Bigger Picture

The Pentalobe screw represents everything wrong with modern tech:

**Environmental Impact:** Unrepairable devices = more e-waste  
**Economic Impact:** Repair monopolies = higher costs for consumers  
**Social Impact:** Learned helplessness = loss of technical literacy
