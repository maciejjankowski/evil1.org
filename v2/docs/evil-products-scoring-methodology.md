# Evil Product Scoring Methodology

## Overview
Our comprehensive Evil Product Score quantifies the true cost of harmful products across multiple dimensions of exploitation and destruction. This scoring system reveals the hidden externalities that corporations impose on society while maximizing profits.

## The Devil's Metrics Framework

### Blood Score (0-5000 points)
**Metric:** Direct and indirect deaths caused by product lifecycle
- **Measurement Unit:** Deaths per million units produced/consumed annually
- **Calculation:** Base deaths √ó Scale factor √ó Intentionality multiplier
- **Examples:**
  - Cigarettes: 4200 points (8 million annual deaths globally)
  - Assault rifles: 4600 points (gun violence epidemic)
  - Coal energy: 3200 points (mining + pollution deaths)
  - Insulin price gouging: 2400 points (rationing deaths)

### Tears Score (0-5000 points)  
**Metric:** Human suffering and quality of life destruction
- **Measurement Unit:** Affected lives √ó Severity index
- **Factors:** Physical pain, mental health, family destruction, community impact
- **Examples:**
  - Slot machines: 4200 points (gambling addiction devastation)
  - Fast fashion: 2800 points (sweatshop conditions, child labor)
  - Social media: 3800 points (mental health crisis, teen suicide)
  - Private prisons: 4000 points (recidivism, family destruction)

### Gold Score (0-5000 points)
**Metric:** Profit extraction through exploitation and externalized costs
- **Measurement Unit:** Markup percentage √ó Volume √ó Externalization factor
- **Calculation:** Considers true cost vs. price paid by society
- **Examples:**
  - Luxury handbags: 3100 points (2000% markup on exploited labor)
  - Payday loans: 3200 points (40000% APR effective rates)
  - Insulin: 2500 points (5000% markup on life-saving medicine)
  - Social media: 2800 points (surveillance capitalism, 90% margins)

### Earth Score (0-2000 points)
**Metric:** Environmental destruction and long-term ecological damage
- **Measurement Unit:** Environmental impact √ó Permanence √ó Scale
- **Factors:** Pollution, resource depletion, climate impact, ecosystem destruction
- **Examples:**
  - Fast fashion: 1820 points (water pollution, microplastics, toxic dyes)
  - Smartphones: 840 points (rare earth mining, e-waste)
  - Coal: 1300 points (climate change, acid rain, mountaintop removal)
  - Plastics: 1400 points (permanent pollution, ocean contamination)

## Total Evil Score Calculation

**Formula:** Blood + Tears + Gold + Earth = Total Evil Score

**Score Ranges:**
- 0-2000: Harmful but manageable
- 2001-4000: Significantly evil
- 4001-6000: Deeply harmful to society
- 6001-8000: Systemically destructive
- 8001-10000: Peak corporate evil

## Scoring Factors

### Intentionality Multiplier (1.0-2.0x)
- **1.0x:** Unintended consequences, negligence
- **1.2x:** Willful ignorance, regulatory evasion
- **1.5x:** Deliberate harm minimization, cover-ups
- **2.0x:** Intentional addiction/harm design, malicious targeting

### Scale Factor
- **Local impact:** 1.0x
- **Regional impact:** 1.5x
- **National impact:** 2.0x
- **Global impact:** 3.0x

### Vulnerability Factor (1.0-2.5x)
- **1.0x:** General population targeting
- **1.5x:** Economic exploitation of poor communities
- **2.0x:** Targeting of children, elderly, or marginalized groups
- **2.5x:** Exploitation of desperate populations (addiction, medical needs)

## Data Sources and Verification

### Primary Sources
- **Health Data:** WHO, CDC, peer-reviewed medical journals
- **Environmental Data:** EPA, IPCC, environmental monitoring organizations
- **Labor Data:** ILO, NGO reports, worker advocacy organizations
- **Financial Data:** Corporate filings, investigative journalism, regulatory documents

### Verification Process
1. **Multi-source confirmation:** Minimum 3 independent sources per major claim
2. **Peer review:** Academic and investigative journalist verification
3. **Regular updates:** Quarterly score adjustments based on new evidence
4. **Transparency:** All scoring rationale and sources publicly documented

## Industry Baseline Comparisons

### Highest Scoring Categories
1. **Tobacco Products:** Average 9750 points (addiction + death design)
2. **Weapons Manufacturing:** Average 9300 points (violence optimization)
3. **Opioid Pharmaceuticals:** Average 9400 points (addiction capitalism)
4. **Coal Energy:** Average 9850 points (climate destruction)
5. **For-Profit Healthcare:** Average 9200 points (commodified life/death)

### Most Exploitative Supply Chains
1. **Electronics:** Conflict minerals, child labor, worker suicides
2. **Fast Fashion:** Global sweatshop network, environmental devastation
3. **Industrial Agriculture:** Monoculture destruction, farmer exploitation

### Highest Profit Extraction
1. **Pharmaceuticals:** 5000% markups on life-saving medicines
2. **Payday Loans:** 40000% APR effective interest rates
3. **Luxury Goods:** 2000% markups on exploited labor
4. **Bottled Water:** 1000% markup on public resources

## Limitations and Considerations

### Scoring Challenges
- **Data availability:** Corporate secrecy limits comprehensive analysis
- **Indirect effects:** Difficult to quantify all downstream consequences
- **Temporal factors:** Long-term impacts may not be fully understood
- **Regional variations:** Impact varies significantly by location

### Methodology Updates
- **Quarterly reviews:** Incorporate new research and evidence
- **Stakeholder input:** NGO, academic, and survivor community feedback
- **Transparency reports:** Public documentation of scoring changes
- **Bias audits:** Regular review for scoring methodology fairness

## Score Interpretation Guidelines

### Using Evil Scores
- **Comparative analysis:** Compare products within and across categories
- **Consumer awareness:** Understand true cost of purchasing decisions
- **Policy advocacy:** Evidence for regulation and corporate accountability
- **Investment decisions:** ESG screening and divestment strategies

### What Scores Don't Measure
- **Individual responsibility:** Focuses on corporate/systemic harm
- **Necessity factors:** Some harmful products may be temporarily necessary
- **Improvement efforts:** Scores reflect current state, not corporate promises
- **Regional alternatives:** Availability of better options varies by location

## Corporate Response and Gaming Prevention

### Common Corporate Tactics
- **Greenwashing:** Environmental marketing without substance
- **CSR theater:** Performative social responsibility programs
- **Data manipulation:** Selective reporting and statistical gaming
- **Regulatory capture:** Influencing standards and enforcement

### Gaming Prevention Measures
- **Independent verification:** Third-party data validation
- **Holistic assessment:** Considers entire product lifecycle
- **Transparent methodology:** Public scoring criteria prevent manipulation
- **Regular updates:** Rapid response to new evidence

## Using This Methodology

This scoring system provides a framework for understanding the true cost of products beyond their market price. While no scoring system can capture every nuance of harm, this methodology offers a systematic approach to evaluating corporate impact on society.

**Key Applications:**
- **Consumer Education:** Understanding product impacts
- **Policy Development:** Evidence for regulation
- **Investment Screening:** ESG evaluation criteria
- **Academic Research:** Quantitative framework for harm analysis
- **Activism:** Data-driven corporate accountability

The methodology continues to evolve based on new research, stakeholder feedback, and emerging understanding of corporate harm patterns.
