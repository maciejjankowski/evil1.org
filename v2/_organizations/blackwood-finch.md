### Landmark Case: The "Genericide" Precedent

When a pharmaceutical client's patent on a life-saving drug was about to expire, Blackwood & Finch pioneered the "genericide" strategy. By filing a series of frivolous lawsuits against generic manufacturers, we successfully delayed the entry of affordable alternatives into the market for another five years, generating an additional $8 billion in revenue for our client.
