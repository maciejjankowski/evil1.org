# Susan Wojcicki: The YouTube Empress

## From Google Garage to Video Empire

Susan Wojcicki transformed YouTube from a startup into the world's most influential video platform. Her leadership created a system that amplifies harmful content for profit while claiming to promote free expression.

## The Algorithm of Harm
YouTube's algorithm prioritizes engagement over truth, amplifying conspiracy theories, hate speech, and misinformation. Wojcicki claimed the algorithm was neutral while it destroyed lives and societies.

## The Ad Revenue Machine
YouTube generates billions from advertising while creators struggle to monetize. The platform takes a significant cut while providing minimal support for content moderation.

## The Child Exploitation
YouTube has been criticized for allowing child exploitation content and predatory behavior. Wojcicki's moderation policies prioritized profit over child safety.

## The Creator Exploitation
YouTube changes its policies frequently, often reducing creator revenue. The platform uses its monopoly power to dictate terms that favor Google's bottom line.

## The Privacy Invasion
YouTube tracks extensive user data for advertising purposes. Wojcicki claimed to care about privacy while building one of the world's largest surveillance systems.

## The Executive Compensation
Wojcicki earned hundreds of millions from Google stock during her tenure. Her wealth comes from a platform that profits from human attention and division.
