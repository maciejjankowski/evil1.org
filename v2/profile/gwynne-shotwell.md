# Gwynne Shotwell: The Space Profiteer

## From Engineering to Empire

Gwynne Shotwell runs SpaceX's business operations while Elon Musk gets the headlines. Her leadership represents the ultimate government subsidy extraction, using taxpayer money to build private wealth and monopoly power.

## The NASA Welfare Queen
SpaceX has received over $15 billion in NASA contracts and subsidies. Shotwell uses government money to develop reusable rockets that compete with traditional aerospace companies.

## The Launch Monopoly
SpaceX controls a majority of commercial launches, using its market power to charge premium prices. The company has been accused of unfair competition and anti-competitive practices.

## The Worker Exploitation
SpaceX maintains grueling work conditions with long hours and high pressure. Shotwell oversees a culture that prioritizes production over worker safety and well-being.

## The Starlink Profiteering
SpaceX's Starlink internet service charges high prices for satellite internet while receiving government subsidies. The system has been criticized for interference and environmental impact.

## The Executive Compensation
Shotwell earned $39 million in 2021, including stock awards. Her wealth comes from a company built on government contracts and subsidies.

## The Space Race Distraction
While promising to make space accessible, SpaceX prioritizes profit over safety and environmental concerns. Shotwell's business acumen enables Musk's hype machine.
