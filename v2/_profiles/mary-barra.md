# Mary Barra: The GM Resuscitator

## From Bankruptcy to Billion-Dollar Profits

Mary Barra took over GM during its darkest hour and turned it into a profitable behemoth. Her leadership represents the ultimate corporate turnaround: use government bailouts, crush unions, and profit from safety failures.

## The Ignition Switch Scandal
Under Barra's leadership, GM covered up a deadly ignition switch defect that killed over 100 people. The company knew about the problem for years but prioritized profits over safety.

## The Government Bailout Exploitation
GM received $50 billion in taxpayer money during the 2009 bailout. Barra used this money to restructure while maintaining executive pay and crushing union demands.

## The Union Busting
Barra has aggressively fought against United Auto Workers, using bankruptcy proceedings to break union contracts and reduce worker compensation. Her anti-union stance has become legendary in Detroit.

## The Electric Vehicle Profiteering
GM charges premium prices for electric vehicles while receiving massive government subsidies. Barra positions GM as environmentally responsible while the company fights against stronger emissions standards.

## The Executive Compensation
Barra earned $29 million in 2022, including stock awards. Her compensation is tied to GM's stock performance, which benefits from government subsidies and union-busting.

## The Safety Culture
Despite the ignition switch scandal, Barra claims GM has a "safety culture." The reality is continued cost-cutting that prioritizes profits over human life.
