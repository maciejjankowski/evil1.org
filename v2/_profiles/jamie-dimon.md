# Jamie Dimon: The Untouchable Banker

## The Man Who Broke the Bank... And Got Paid For It

Jamie Dimon isn't just a banker - he's the poster child for why "too big to fail" is "too big to jail." As CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank, Dimon has turned financial crisis into personal profit while his institution has paid over $40 billion in fines since 2008.

## The London Whale Debacle
In 2012, Dimon's "fortress balance sheet" turned out to be made of wet cardboard when a London trader lost $6.2 billion in a single day. Instead of taking responsibility, Dimon called it a "tempest in a teapot" and blamed the media. The bank paid $920 million in fines, but Dimon kept his job and bonus.

## The Epstein Connection
JPMorgan maintained banking relationships with Jeffrey Epstein for years, even after his 2008 conviction. Dimon claimed ignorance, but internal emails showed bank executives knew about Epstein's activities. The bank only cut ties in 2013 after public pressure.

## Mortgage Fraud and Robo-Signing
During the housing crisis, JPMorgan purchased $78 billion in toxic mortgages from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. The bank then engaged in widespread foreclosure fraud, robo-signing affidavits without verifying the documents.

## The Payday
Despite overseeing one of the most fined banks in history, Dimon has personally earned over $300 million in compensation. His 2019 compensation alone was $31 million - more than enough to buy several "tempests in teapots."

## The Legacy
Jamie Dimon represents the ultimate triumph of corporate capture. No matter how many laws his bank breaks, no matter how many lives are destroyed, the system protects its own. He's not just running a bank - he's running the ultimate protection racket.
