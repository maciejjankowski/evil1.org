# The Rise of John Corporate

John Corporate's career trajectory reads like a case study in corporate corruption. Starting as a mid-level accountant, he rose through the ranks by mastering the dark arts of financial manipulation and regulatory evasion.

## Early Career

Corporate began his career at EvilCorp's accounting department in 1998. His first major "achievement" was restructuring the company's offshore tax havens, saving EvilCorp $2.3 billion in taxes over five years.

## The Big Break

In 2005, Corporate orchestrated the company's hostile takeover of a smaller competitor. The deal involved creative accounting that hid $500 million in debt from shareholders. When the truth emerged, Corporate claimed ignorance and was promoted to CFO.

## CEO Ascension

By 2012, Corporate had become CEO. Under his leadership, EvilCorp:
- Laid off 15,000 workers while executive pay increased 300%
- Spent $50 million on lobbying against environmental regulations
- Settled three major fraud cases for $1.2 billion (without admitting wrongdoing)

## Current Status

Today, Corporate sits on the boards of 12 Fortune 500 companies and chairs the industry's lobbying group. His net worth exceeds $500 million, built largely on the backs of exploited workers and environmental destruction.

## Legacy

Corporate's career demonstrates how corporate corruption rewards the ruthless. His story is a stark reminder that unchecked capitalism creates monsters, not millionaires.
