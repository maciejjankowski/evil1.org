## The Vanguard Playbook: A How-To Guide for Corporate Deception

At Vanguard PR, we believe that any crisis can be managed with the right narrative. Here are some of the key strategies from our proprietary playbook.

### The "Limited Hangout"

When facing a scandal, admit to a small, manageable part of the problem. This creates the illusion of transparency and allows you to control the narrative, while keeping the more damaging details hidden.

**Example:** If your company is caught dumping toxic waste, issue a press release apologizing for "minor procedural oversights" in your waste management process.

### The "False Equivalence"

Position your critics as being just as biased as you are. Frame the debate as a "difference of opinion" rather than a matter of fact.

**Example:** When scientists release a study showing your product is harmful, fund your own "independent" study that reaches the opposite conclusion. Then, claim that the "scientific community is divided."

### The "Dead Cat" Strategy

When you're in trouble, throw something shocking onto the table that everyone is forced to talk about instead.

**Example:** If you're about to be hit with a massive fine, announce a bold (but ultimately meaningless) new "green initiative." The media will be so busy covering your announcement that they'll forget about the fine.
