# Value Extraction: Squeezing Every Penny from Your Pocket

Value extraction is the corporate art of getting more money from consumers than the actual value provided. It's not about fair exchange - it's about psychological manipulation, hidden fees, data mining, and subscription traps. Corporations don't want satisfied customers who stop buying; they want addicted users who keep paying forever. Every interaction is optimized for profit extraction, not customer satisfaction.

- **Behavioral Tracking**: Monitoring every click and purchase
- **Personalization Pricing**: Charging different prices based on data
- **Targeted Advertising**: Selling your attention to advertisers

### Hidden Fees
