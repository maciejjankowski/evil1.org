# Planned Obsolescence: Built to Break, Designed to Profit

Planned obsolescence is the corporate strategy of designing products to fail after a predetermined time, forcing consumers to buy replacements. It's not about quality or durability - it's about maximizing profits through engineered waste. Corporations don't want products that last forever; they want products that fail just when you're ready to stop buying.

## The Obsolescence Strategy

### Designed to Fail
Products are engineered with intentional weaknesses:
- **Cheap Components**: Using lowest-cost parts that fail quickly
- **Software Updates**: That slow down older devices
- **Incompatible Upgrades**: That require new hardware
- **Consumable Parts**: That need frequent replacement

### Profit Through Waste
The business model is simple:
- Sell cheap products that fail quickly
- Charge premium for replacements
- Create artificial demand through "upgrades"
- Externalize environmental costs to society

### Consumer Manipulation
- **Fashion Cycles**: Making products "outdated" through marketing
- **Software Bloat**: Updates that require more powerful hardware
- **Subscription Models**: Turning ownership into rentals
- **Warranty Games**: Repairs cost more than replacements

## The Obsolescence Techniques

### Component Degradation
- **Battery Chemistry**: Lithium-ion batteries designed to last 2-3 years
- **Plastic Components**: Cheap plastics that become brittle
- **Electronic Components**: Capacitors and resistors with short lifespans
- **Moving Parts**: Gears and motors that wear out quickly

### Software Sabotage
- **Forced Updates**: That brick older devices
- **Feature Removal**: Disabling capabilities on older models
- **Security Pretexts**: Using "security" to disable working products
- **Compatibility Breaking**: Updates that break older software

### Design Limitations
- **No Repair Access**: Glued, soldered, or potted components
- **Proprietary Parts**: Impossible to source replacements
- **Tool Requirements**: Specialized tools for disassembly
- **Documentation Absence**: No service manuals provided

### Marketing Manipulation
- **Style Obsolescence**: Making products look "old" quickly
- **Feature Inflation**: Adding unnecessary features to justify new models
- **Status Signaling**: Creating social pressure to upgrade
- **Limited Editions**: Creating artificial scarcity

## The Corporate Obsolescence Champions

### Apple: The Upgrade Machine
- **iPhone Batteries**: Throttle performance on "old" devices
- **macOS Updates**: Drop support for older hardware
- **Lightning Cables**: Proprietary connectors that fail
- **Result**: Forced upgrades every 2-3 years

### Microsoft: The Windows Waste
- **Windows Updates**: Bloat that slows older PCs
- **Office Compatibility**: Breaking old document formats
- **Xbox One**: External power bricks that fail
- **Result**: Constant hardware replacement cycles

### Samsung: The Galaxy Graveyard
- **Galaxy Note**: Exploding batteries (not accidental)
- **TouchWiz Updates**: That slow devices to unusability
- **USB-C Ports**: That loosen and fail
- **Result**: Annual flagship replacements

### Sony: The PlayStation Profit
- **PS4 Controllers**: Sticks that drift after 1-2 years
- **Disc Drives**: That fail with regular use
- **Power Supplies**: External bricks that die
- **Result**: Accessory replacement revenue

## The Environmental Catastrophe

### E-Waste Mountains
- **Annual Volume**: 50 million tons of e-waste globally
- **Growth Rate**: Doubling every 5 years
- **Toxic Components**: Heavy metals, plastics, rare earths
- **Landfill Impact**: Poisoning soil and water supplies

### Resource Depletion
- **Rare Earth Mining**: Destructive extraction processes
- **Conflict Minerals**: Funding wars in mining regions
- **Water Consumption**: Billions of gallons for manufacturing
- **Carbon Footprint**: Massive emissions from production

### Circular Economy Myth
- **Recycling Rates**: Less than 20% of e-waste recycled
- **Downcycling**: Materials degraded in recycling process
- **Export Problems**: Toxic waste shipped to developing countries
- **Design Flaws**: Products designed for disposal, not recycling

## The Consumer Cost

### Financial Drain
- **Replacement Cycles**: Buying new products every 1-3 years
- **Accessory Costs**: Cables, chargers, cases that fail
- **Data Migration**: Time and cost of moving to new devices
- **Learning Curves**: Time lost relearning interfaces

### Time Waste
- **Setup Time**: Configuring new devices
- **Troubleshooting**: Dealing with failures
- **Data Recovery**: Retrieving lost information
- **Customer Service**: Hours on hold with support

### Emotional Toll
- **Frustration**: Constant device failures
- **Anxiety**: Fear of losing important data
- **Helplessness**: Unable to repair or maintain products
- **Guilt**: Environmental impact awareness

## The Obsolescence Excuses

### "Innovation"
- **Corporate Claim**: New features require new hardware
- **Reality**: Most "innovations" are unnecessary
- **Benefit**: Justifies forced upgrades

### "Security"
- **Corporate Claim**: Old devices can't be secured
- **Reality**: Security through software, not hardware replacement
- **Benefit**: Creates fear to drive sales

### "Performance"
- **Corporate Claim**: Apps require more power
- **Reality**: Bloatware and inefficient code
- **Benefit**: Forces hardware upgrades

### "User Demand"
- **Corporate Claim**: Consumers want new features
- **Reality**: Marketing creates artificial demand
- **Benefit**: Blames consumers for waste

## Fighting Planned Obsolescence

### Right to Repair
- **Legislation**: Laws requiring repair access
- **Documentation**: Service manuals and schematics
- **Parts Availability**: Genuine replacement parts
- **Tools**: Standardized repair tools

### Product Durability
- **Quality Standards**: Minimum lifespan requirements
- **Warranty Extensions**: Longer coverage periods
- **Repair Incentives**: Subsidized repair costs
- **Upgrade Options**: Modular design for upgrades

### Consumer Action
- **Buy Used**: Extend product lifecycles
- **Repair Culture**: Learn to fix devices
- **Boycott**: Avoid companies with obsolescence practices
- **Demand Change**: Support repair-friendly legislation

### Alternative Models
- **Fairphone**: Modular, repairable smartphones
- **Framework**: Upgradeable laptop components
- **Open Source**: Software that runs on old hardware
- **Circular Design**: Products designed for disassembly

## The Obsolescence Future

Corporations are developing next-generation obsolescence:
- **Smart Degradation**: IoT devices that fail when subscriptions end
- **Biological Obsolescence**: Supplements that create dependency
- **Neural Obsolescence**: Brain implants that require updates
- **Quantum Obsolescence**: Computing that becomes obsolete instantly

The goal is total control over product lifecycles. Not just devices, but your health, your thoughts, your very biology become obsolete by design.

Planned obsolescence isn't about progress - it's about profit through destruction. It's about creating artificial scarcity in a world of abundance. It's about corporations profiting from waste while society pays the environmental and social costs.

Fight back. Demand products that last. Support repair rights. Choose durability over disposability. The future should be sustainable, not systematically wasteful.
