## Manufacturing Doubt: The Science Division of Vanguard PR

Facts are stubborn things, but they are no match for a well-funded public relations campaign. At Vanguard PR's internal "Science & Strategy" division, we specialize in manufacturing doubt and turning scientific consensus into a "healthy debate."

### The Playbook:

1.  **Fund "Independent" Research:** Identify and fund scientists at obscure universities who are willing to produce research that aligns with our clients' interests. The key is to create a "paper trail" of seemingly credible, peer-reviewed studies that can be used to counter mainstream science.

2.  **Promote "The Maverick":** Find a charismatic scientist with a contrarian view and elevate them as a "brave, independent thinker" who is "not afraid to challenge the establishment." Book them on news shows, place their op-eds in major newspapers, and watch as they become the face of the "other side" of the debate.

3.  **Attack the Consensus:** Frame the scientific consensus not as a strength, but as a sign of a closed-minded, dogmatic "orthodoxy." Use phrases like "the science is not settled" and "we need more research" to create the impression of uncertainty, even when none exists.

From climate change to public health, our Science & Strategy division has successfully delayed regulation, protected profits, and ensured that the "debate" continues for decades.
