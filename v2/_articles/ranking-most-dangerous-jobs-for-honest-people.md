# Ranking the Most Dangerous Jobs for Honest People

In today's corporate landscape, honesty isn't just unrewarded - it's actively punished. This ranking examines professions where ethical employees face the highest risk of retaliation, career destruction, and personal ruin. Based on whistleblower reports, legal cases, and industry data, here are the most perilous careers for truth-tellers.
