## The Satirical Point

This "Bad LinkedIn" concept satirizes how corporations often prioritize profits over people and planet. In reality, many face lawsuits, fines, and boycotts, but systemic change remains elusive.

## Real-World Consequences

These "achievements" have led to:
- Environmental devastation
- Public health crises
- Economic inequality
- Erosion of democracy

## The Need for Accountability

While satire highlights the absurdities, real change requires:
- Stricter regulations
