    \                   \n                        What Does This T-Shirt Actually
    Mean?\n                        This t-shirt is a meta-commentary on consumerism.
    It acknowledges that you're buying a product while simultaneously mocking you
    for doing so. It's capitalism eating itself.\n\n                        The Layers

    you how much it costs, which is something no other t-shirt does.\n                            \n\n

    participant in the capitalist system by buying it.\n                            \n\n

    Layer 4: The Recursion\n                                By buying this t-shirt
    that mocks buying t-shirts, you're engaging in the very behavior it's mocking.\n

    Philosophical Question\n                        If a t-shirt mocks consumerism,
    but you buy it to signal your anti-consumerist views, are you still a consumerist?
    The answer is yes, and this t-shirt is happy to take your money to prove it.\n
