    - title: "Why Polish Doctors Are Coming to Save Texas"
      content: |
        Imagine walking into a hospital and NEVER seeing a bill. 
        
        Imagine prescription medications at actual cost, not 2,000% markup.
        
        Imagine doctors who spend 20 minutes with you, not 7 minutes rushing to the next payment.
        
        This isn't fantasy - it's Polish healthcare. And it's coming to Texas.
        
        The Medical University of Bia≈Çystok, renowned for training some of Europe's finest physicians, is proposing a medical enclave on Texas soil. Polish sovereignty, European healthcare standards, American patients.
        
        Why? Because Polish people believe healthcare is a human right, not a commodity to be sold to the highest bidder.
