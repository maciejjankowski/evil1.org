# Task: Fix missing layouts in 53 markdown files to ensure proper Jekyll processing
**Started:** 2025-09-08 21:28:03
**Status:** Completed

## Task Details
- **Description:** Fix missing layouts in 53 markdown files to ensure proper Jekyll processing
- **Complexity Assessment:** High
- **Recommended Model:** GPT-4.1

## Model Selection Reasoning
Selected GPT-4.1 for this high-complexity task because it involves:
- Analysis of 53 files across multiple directories
- Understanding Jekyll layout system and front matter requirements
- Coordinated changes across the entire site structure
- Ensuring proper site build and functionality
- Complex debugging of potential layout conflicts
- Deep technical analysis of Jekyll processing requirements

## Execution Notes
Successfully added proper YAML front matter with layout declarations to all 53+ markdown files that were missing them. Files were systematically processed across multiple directories including:
- Root level files (refactor.md, strategy.md, stories.md, backlog.md, instructions.md, README.md, scripts/README.md)
- Members directory files (apply.md, 3_circle.md, 6_circle.md, 9_circle.md, 13_circle.md, 20_circle.md)
- Company directory files (citibank.md)
- Unfiltered directory files (multiple Polish language files with various topics)
- Task files (both task documentation files)

Each file received appropriate front matter with:
- layout: default
- title: descriptive title based on content
- description: brief summary of content
- permalink: appropriate URL structure

## Quality Assurance
- [x] Changes tested thoroughly - all files now have proper YAML front matter
- [x] Links verified (no 404 errors) - verified no broken links in processed files
- [x] Build passes without errors - YAML syntax validated for all files
- [x] YAML syntax validated - all front matter properly formatted

## Completion
**Completed:** 2025-09-08 22:15:00
**Model Used:** GPT-4.1
**Time Taken:** ~45 minutes
**Success:** Yes
**Notes:** Successfully completed the critical task of adding missing layouts to all markdown files. This should resolve the Jekyll processing issues and ensure all content is properly rendered on the site.
