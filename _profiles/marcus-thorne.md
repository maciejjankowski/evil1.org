## Marcus Thorne: The Corporate Raider's Lawyer

**Title:** Senior Partner, Blackwood & Finch LLP

**Bio:**

Marcus Thorne is the legal mind behind some of the most aggressive corporate maneuvers of the last decade. As a senior partner at Blackwood & Finch, he has made a name for himself by finding legal justifications for actions that others would deem indefensible. He views the law not as a set of rules, but as a collection of tools to be wielded for his clients' advantage.

His specialty is turning legal shields into offensive weapons.

**Notable Achievements:**

*   Developed the "patent trolling" strategy that allowed a tech giant to sue its smaller competitors into bankruptcy.
*   Structured the offshore holding companies that have allowed his clients to avoid an estimated $50 billion in taxes.
*   Successfully argued that a company's internal documents detailing known product defects were "proprietary trade secrets" and therefore inadmissible in court.

**Quote:** *"My job isn't to argue what's right. It's to argue what's legal. And if it's not legal, we'll find a way to make it so."*
