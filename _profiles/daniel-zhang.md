# Daniel Zhang: The Alibaba Emperor

## From E-commerce to Empire

Daniel Zhang built Alibaba into China's largest company through aggressive expansion and monopoly practices. His leadership represents the intersection of capitalism and authoritarianism, using government connections to crush competition.

## The Antitrust Violations
Alibaba has been fined billions for antitrust violations in China. Zhang's company used its market power to force merchants to choose between Alibaba platforms, creating unfair monopolies.

## The Data Monopoly
Alibaba controls massive amounts of consumer and merchant data. This data is used for surveillance, credit scoring, and market manipulation, often in coordination with Chinese government authorities.

## The Regulatory Capture
Zhang has close ties to Chinese Communist Party officials, using political connections to maintain market dominance. Alibaba's success depends on government favoritism and regulatory capture.

## The Worker Exploitation
Alibaba's delivery network relies on exploited workers facing poor conditions and low pay. The company has been accused of using algorithms to maximize worker utilization while minimizing compensation.

## The International Expansion
Zhang has expanded Alibaba globally, using Chinese market practices in international contexts. The company has faced accusations of technology transfer requirements and unfair competition.

## The Wealth Accumulation
Zhang's net worth exceeds $50 billion, built on maintaining monopolies and exploiting China's e-commerce market. His wealth comes from a system that prioritizes corporate power over consumer welfare.
