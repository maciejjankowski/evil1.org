# Brian Cornell: The Target Titan

## From Walmart to Target Domination

Brian Cornell brought Walmart's ruthless efficiency to Target, creating a retail behemoth that exploits workers and collects data while maintaining a "cheap chic" image. His leadership represents the ultimate retail consolidation.

## The Worker Exploitation
Target pays low wages and provides minimal benefits while demanding high productivity. The company has been accused of wage theft and creating unsafe working conditions.

## The Data Mining Operation
Target collects extensive customer data through its app, loyalty program, and in-store tracking. This data is used for targeted marketing and price discrimination.

## The Union Busting Legacy
Cornell's Walmart experience included aggressive anti-union tactics. At Target, he continues to fight unionization efforts, maintaining low wages and poor working conditions.

## The Store Closures
Target has closed hundreds of stores while opening smaller-format stores that employ fewer workers. This strategy maximizes profits while minimizing labor costs.

## The Executive Pay
Cornell earned $19 million in 2022, including stock awards. His compensation is tied to Target's stock performance, which benefits from cost-cutting and data exploitation.

## The "Discount" Deception
Target markets itself as affordable, but its prices are often higher than Walmart's. The "premium" positioning allows for higher margins and profit extraction.
