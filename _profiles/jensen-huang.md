# Jensen Huang: The GPU Godfather

## From Graphics to AI Domination

Jensen Huang created the GPU market and now dominates AI computing. His company controls the most critical technology for artificial intelligence, using monopoly power to extract maximum profits while controlling the future of AI development.

## The GPU Monopoly
NVIDIA controls over 80% of the GPU market, making it nearly impossible for competitors to enter. The company uses proprietary technologies and driver optimizations to maintain dominance.

## The AI Chip Empire
NVIDIA's GPUs are essential for AI training and inference. Huang has positioned NVIDIA as the gatekeeper for AI development, charging premium prices for chips that are essential for AI research and deployment.

## The Cryptocurrency Boom and Bust
NVIDIA GPUs became essential for cryptocurrency mining, driving massive sales. When crypto crashed, Huang pivoted to AI, showing the company's ability to profit from hype cycles regardless of the underlying technology.

## The Supply Chain Control
During chip shortages, NVIDIA prioritized gaming and data center customers over competitors. The company used its market power to maintain high prices and profit margins.

## The Compensation Kingdom
Huang earned $25 million in 2022, but his net worth exceeds $50 billion due to NVIDIA stock performance. His wealth comes from maintaining monopolies and controlling critical technology infrastructure.

## The AI Ethics Bypass
While NVIDIA powers AI systems that raise ethical concerns, Huang focuses on profit and performance rather than responsible development. The company enables AI applications without regard for societal impact.
