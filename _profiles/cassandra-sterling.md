## Cassandra Sterling: The Queen of Spin

**Title:** Founder & CEO, Vanguard PR

**Bio:**

Cassandra Sterling founded Vanguard PR on the principle that "perception is reality." A master of public relations, she has built a career on turning corporate disasters into brand triumphs. With a background in political campaign management, Cassandra understands that the truth is often less important than the story you tell.

Her philosophy is simple: "We don't solve problems; we re-brand them."

**Notable Achievements:**

*   Successfully re-branded a toxic industrial chemical as a "vital component for modern living."
*   Orchestrated a media campaign that portrayed a company's mass layoffs as a "strategic realignment for future growth," resulting in a 15% stock price increase.
*   Pioneered the use of AI-driven social media bots to create the illusion of grassroots support for deregulation.

**Quote:** *"The public doesn't want the truth. They want a story they can believe in. We give them one."*
