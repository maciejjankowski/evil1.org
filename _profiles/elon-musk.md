# Elon Musk: The Hype Machine

## From PayPal to Planetary Domination

Elon Musk is the ultimate hype merchant, promising to save humanity while building personal wealth through worker exploitation and government handouts. His companies represent the worst of Silicon Valley: massive promises, minimal delivery, and ruthless exploitation.

## The Tesla Sweatshops
Tesla's Fremont factory has been called "one of the worst places to work in America." Workers face extreme pressure, long hours, and dangerous conditions. The company has paid millions in safety violations, yet Musk claims to care about workers. In 2018, a Tesla worker died after being crushed by a robot.

## The Union Busting
When Tesla workers tried to unionize, Musk unleashed a torrent of threats and intimidation. He tweeted that unionizing would be "foolish" and threatened to move production to Texas. The NLRB found Tesla guilty of multiple unfair labor practices.

## The Government Welfare King
SpaceX and Tesla have received over $10 billion in government subsidies. Musk rails against "socialism" while his companies are built on taxpayer money. Tesla received $1.3 billion in tax credits for each Gigafactory built.

## The Twitter Takeover
Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X) was financed with Tesla stock, effectively using shareholder money to buy a social media company. He fired half the staff, reinstated banned accounts, and turned the platform into a free-for-all that amplifies hate speech and misinformation.

## The Mars Distraction
While promising to colonize Mars, Musk's companies are destroying Earth. Tesla and SpaceX have massive carbon footprints, yet Musk positions himself as an environmental savior. It's the ultimate greenwashing campaign.

## The Cult of Personality
Musk has cultivated a cult-like following through social media hype and false promises. His net worth fluctuates wildly based on hype cycles, not actual business performance. He's the ultimate manifestation of capitalist theater.
