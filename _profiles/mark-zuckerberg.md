# Mark Zuckerberg: The Privacy Predator

## From Dorm Room to Digital Dictator

Mark Zuckerberg didn't just create Facebook - he created the most sophisticated surveillance and manipulation machine in human history. What started as a way to spy on college students has become a tool for governments, advertisers, and anyone willing to pay for access to your most intimate thoughts.

## The Cambridge Analytica Scandal
In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 87 million Facebook users without consent. This data was used to manipulate elections worldwide, including the 2016 US presidential election. Zuckerberg's response? "This was a major breach of trust."

## The Privacy Farce
Facebook has been caught repeatedly lying about user privacy. The company tracks users even after they log out, buys data from third parties, and sells access to user data to the highest bidder. Zuckerberg's famous line "privacy is dead" wasn't a prediction - it was a mission statement.

## The Myanmar Genocide
Facebook's algorithms amplified hate speech that contributed to the genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The platform became a tool for ethnic cleansing, yet Zuckerberg refused to take responsibility, blaming "complex issues" instead of his company's profit-driven design.

## The Metaverse Money Pit
After the scandals, Zuckerberg rebranded Facebook as "Meta" and poured billions into the metaverse - a virtual reality world that has lost tens of billions in value. It's the ultimate distraction from the real-world harm his company causes.

## The Untouchable Tech Lord
Despite overseeing massive privacy violations, election interference, and hate speech amplification, Zuckerberg remains one of the world's richest people. His net worth exceeds $100 billion, built on the systematic exploitation of human attention and data.
