# Reed Hastings: The Streaming Sultan

## From DVDs to Digital Domination

Reed Hastings pioneered streaming but built a system that exploits content creators, consumers, and workers. Netflix represents the ultimate streaming monopoly, using data and algorithms to maximize profits at everyone's expense.

## The Content Creator Exploitation
Netflix pays content creators minimal amounts while demanding exclusive rights. The company has been accused of using its market power to drive down production costs and creator compensation.

## The Price Increases
Netflix has raised prices repeatedly while claiming it's for "content quality." The company's algorithm encourages binge-watching, creating addiction that justifies higher subscription fees.

## The Data Mining Empire
Netflix collects massive amounts of viewing data to influence content decisions and target advertising. Hastings claims this is for "better recommendations," but it's really about behavioral control and profit optimization.

## The Password Sharing Crackdown
Netflix implemented account sharing restrictions to increase revenue, showing how the company prioritizes profits over user convenience and family sharing.

## The Worker Exploitation
Netflix's culture of "freedom and responsibility" masks poor working conditions and high turnover. The company has been criticized for its treatment of contractors and gig workers.

## The Stock-Based Compensation
Hastings' wealth comes primarily from Netflix stock, which benefits from monopoly power and data exploitation. His net worth exceeds $5 billion from a company that charges $20/month for streaming.
