# Corporate Evil Assessment Tool (CEAT)™
## Discover Your Executive Archetype

### Welcome to Your Personalized Evil Profile

Based on extensive research into corporate psychopathy and systematic exploitation patterns, the **Corporate Evil Assessment Tool (CEAT)** has analyzed your responses to determine your unique brand of capitalist malevolence.

## Your CEAT Type: The Institutional Sociopath

**Primary Traits:** Systemic exploitation, moral flexibility, profit optimization

### Cognitive Functions Stack:
1. **Dominant: Profit Extraction (Pe)** - Your primary mode of operation involves identifying and maximizing extractable value from any situation, regardless of human cost.

2. **Auxiliary: Blame Deflection (Bd)** - You excel at redirecting responsibility for negative outcomes while claiming credit for any perceived benefits.

3. **Tertiary: Regulatory Capture (Rc)** - You instinctively identify ways to transform public resources and institutions into private profit centers.

4. **Inferior: Human Empathy (He)** - This remains severely underdeveloped, allowing for optimal decision-making unencumbered by ethical considerations.

### Your Strengths in Corporate Environments:
- **Strategic Dehumanization**: Ability to view workers as expendable resources rather than human beings
- **Moral Arbitrage**: Expertise in exploiting ethical blind spots for competitive advantage
- **Systemic Manipulation**: Natural talent for corrupting institutions while maintaining façade of legitimacy
- **Stakeholder Prioritization**: Instinctive understanding that shareholders matter more than stakeholders

### Career Compatibility:
**Highly Compatible Roles:**
- Fortune 500 CEO
- Investment Banking Executive
- Pharmaceutical Industry Leader
- Oil & Gas Executive
- Private Equity Managing Partner
- Defense Contractor Executive

**Moderately Compatible Roles:**
- Corporate Lobbyist
- Management Consultant
- Real Estate Developer
- Tech Platform Owner

**Incompatible Roles:**
- Social Worker
- Environmental Scientist
- Labor Organizer
- Investigative Journalist
- Human Rights Advocate

### Relationship Dynamics:
Your CEAT type suggests you form transactional relationships based on utility rather than genuine human connection. You're most compatible with other corporate archetypes who share your profit-first worldview.

**Best Matches:**
- Other Institutional Sociopaths
- Regulatory Capture Specialists
- Professional Gaslighters

**Challenging Matches:**
- Anyone with functional empathy
- Environmental advocates
- Worker rights supporters
- Journalists investigating corruption

### Development Recommendations:
To maximize your corporate evil potential, consider:

1. **Advanced Gaslighting Training**: Improve your ability to make victims question their own reality
2. **Regulatory Capture Workshops**: Learn cutting-edge techniques for corrupting public institutions
3. **Stakeholder Management**: Master the art of managing different exploitation targets
4. **Crisis Communication**: Develop skills for maintaining public image during scandals

### Warning Signs of Empathy Development:
If you experience any of the following, seek immediate consultation:
- Concern for worker welfare
- Environmental consciousness
- Desire for fair taxation
- Impulse to tell the truth
- Consideration of long-term consequences

### Remember:
Your CEAT results are not destiny—they're a roadmap to maximizing your potential for systematic harm while maintaining legal immunity. Use this knowledge wisely to climb the corporate ladder and extract maximum value from society.
