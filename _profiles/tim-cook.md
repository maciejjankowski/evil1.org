# Tim Cook: The Tax Dodger

## From Operations to Optimization

Tim Cook inherited Steve Jobs's company and turned it into the ultimate tax avoidance machine. While preaching about values and innovation, Cook has overseen the systematic exploitation of workers and the creative use of Irish tax laws to avoid paying billions in taxes.

## The Irish Tax Dodge
Apple has avoided paying billions in taxes by routing profits through Ireland. The EU ruled that Apple's Irish tax deal was illegal state aid, but the company continues to use similar schemes. Cook claims this is "following the law," but it's really about following the money.

## The Foxconn Nightmare
Apple's products are assembled by Foxconn workers in China who face brutal conditions: 12-hour shifts, military-style management, and suicide nets around buildings. When workers tried to unionize, they were fired. Cook has visited Foxconn but claims the company has no control over working conditions.

## The Planned Obsolescence
Apple designs products to fail, forcing consumers to buy new devices every few years. This "upgrade culture" generates massive profits but creates mountains of electronic waste. Cook talks about environmental responsibility while his company is a major contributor to e-waste.

## The App Store Monopoly
Apple takes a 30% cut of all App Store sales, making billions from developers' work. The company has been sued for antitrust violations, but continues to maintain its monopoly power. Cook claims this is about "security," but it's really about profit.

## The Privacy Preacher
While collecting massive amounts of user data, Cook positions Apple as a privacy champion. The company tracks users through device identifiers and sells access to advertising partners. It's the ultimate hypocrisy.

## The Compensation King
Despite overseeing massive tax avoidance and worker exploitation, Cook earned $99 million in 2020. His compensation is 1,000 times that of the average Apple employee, yet he talks about "fairness" and "equality."
