# Satya Nadella: The Cloud Conqueror

## From Server Rooms to Surveillance State

Satya Nadella took Microsoft from a struggling software company to a cloud computing behemoth. Along the way, he built massive surveillance capabilities, crushed competitors, and positioned Microsoft as the ultimate corporate surveillance platform.

## The GitHub Acquisition
Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, then proceeded to undermine the open source community it claimed to support. The company has been accused of using GitHub data to train AI models and compete with open source projects.

## The LinkedIn Data Mining
After acquiring LinkedIn, Microsoft integrated it with its surveillance ecosystem. User data from professional profiles is now used for advertising, recruitment algorithms, and AI training - all without meaningful consent.

## The Azure Monopoly
Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become the de facto standard for enterprise computing. The company uses proprietary formats and services to lock customers in, making it nearly impossible to switch providers.

## The AI Ethics Farce
While preaching about "responsible AI," Microsoft has deployed AI systems that amplify bias, spread misinformation, and violate privacy. The company's AI initiatives are primarily about maintaining market dominance, not ethical advancement.

## The Activision Deal
Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard was approved despite concerns about market concentration. Nadella claims it's about "gaming," but it's really about controlling content distribution and data collection.

## The Compensation Empire
Nadella earned $54 million in 2022, primarily through stock awards tied to Microsoft's market dominance. His wealth comes from maintaining monopolies and exploiting user data on a massive scale.
