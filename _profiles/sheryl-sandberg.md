# Sheryl Sandberg: The Facebook Fixer

## From Treasury to Tech Tyranny

Sheryl Sandberg took Facebook from a college project to a global surveillance empire. Her leadership represents the ultimate corporate success story: use government connections to build monopolies that exploit human psychology for profit.

## The Cambridge Analytica Cover-up
Sandberg was intimately involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal but escaped accountability. Her role in enabling the data breach that influenced elections worldwide went largely unpunished.

## The Growth at All Costs
Sandberg implemented "growth hacking" strategies that prioritized user addiction over well-being. Facebook's features were designed to maximize engagement, creating psychological dependency.

## The Myanmar Atrocities
Under Sandberg's leadership, Facebook became a tool for ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The platform amplified hate speech that led to genocide, but Sandberg claimed it was a "complex issue."

## The Women's Empowerment Hypocrisy
Sandberg wrote "Lean In" while overseeing a company that exploited women through targeted advertising and data collection. Her feminism was a marketing tool for a company that objectified users.

## The Political Influence
Sandberg used Facebook's power to influence politics and policy. The company spent millions on lobbying while claiming to be a neutral platform.

## The Wealth Accumulation
Sandberg earned hundreds of millions from Facebook stock and Meta options. Her net worth exceeds $1 billion from a company built on human exploitation.
