# Malevolent Metrics for Corporate Exploitation


## Metric Definitions

- **Greed Index**: Ratio of executive compensation to median worker pay.
- **Olympic Pools of Blood**: Number of lives lost due to corporate actions, converted to volume (1 person ≈ 5 liters blood; Olympic pool ≈ 2,500,000 liters). For smaller amounts, use:
	- Average bathtub ≈ 150 liters
	- Watercooler bottle ≈ 19 liters
- **Containers of Gold**: Financial loss or revenue gained, converted to standard shipping container volume (1 container ≈ 33.2 m³; gold density ≈ 19,320 kg/m³; 1 kg gold ≈ $60,000 in 2025).
- **Pools of Tears**: Number of jobs or homes lost, converted to volume (1 person ≈ 0.25 liters tears/year under stress; Olympic pool ≈ 2,500,000 liters). For smaller amounts, use:
	- Average bathtub ≈ 150 liters
	- Watercooler bottle ≈ 19 liters
- **Sweat Index**: Overtime or unpaid labor, converted to liters of sweat (1 person ≈ 0.5 liters sweat per 8-hour shift). For smaller amounts, use:
	- Average bathtub ≈ 150 liters
	- Watercooler bottle ≈ 19 liters
- **Benefits Burned**: Number of healthcare, pension, or other benefits cut, measured in "burned benefit units" (BBUs).

## Baseline Assessment (2020-2025)

### Greed Index
- US Fortune 500 average CEO-to-worker pay ratio: 324:1 (Source: AFL-CIO)

### Olympic Pools of Blood
- Rana Plaza collapse (Bangladesh, 2013): 1,134 deaths ≈ 5,670 liters blood ≈ 0.0023 Olympic pools ≈ 38 bathtubs
- Amazon warehouse deaths (2013-2023): 10 deaths ≈ 50 liters blood ≈ 0.00002 Olympic pools ≈ 2.6 watercooler bottles

### Containers of Gold
- Meta layoffs (2023): $1.5B saved ≈ 25,000 kg gold ≈ 1.3 containers
- Enron fraud (2001): $74B lost ≈ 1,233,333 kg gold ≈ 62 containers

### Pools of Tears
- Meta layoffs (2023): 11,000 jobs lost ≈ 2,750 liters tears ≈ 0.0011 Olympic pools ≈ 18 bathtubs
- US foreclosures (2008 crisis): 3.8M homes lost ≈ 950,000 liters tears ≈ 0.38 Olympic pools

### Sweat Index
- Amazon overtime (2022): 100,000 workers × 10 extra shifts × 0.5L = 500,000 liters sweat ≈ 0.2 Olympic pools
- Unpaid internships (UK Parliament, 2022): 200 interns × 20 shifts × 0.5L = 2,000 liters sweat ≈ 13 bathtubs

### Benefits Burned
- US healthcare benefits cut (2020-2025): 2M workers lost coverage = 2M BBUs

## Additional Suggested Metrics
- **Carbon Footprint of Evil**: CO₂ emissions from exploitative practices (tons/year)
- **Legal Fees Burned**: Amount spent defending against lawsuits (USD)
- **PR Spin Cycles**: Number of press releases per scandal
