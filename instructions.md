# INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANT

- **IMPORTANT** use files `instructions.md` `workflow.md` `backlog.md` `task-*.md` for instructions for ai agents, dont treat them as source files for evil1.org content.
**IMPORTANT:** Read `workflow.md` for the complete development process and model selection protocols before starting any work.

## Task Management
- After task completion mark the task complete like that: [x]
- Should a task need splitting into smaller tasks, add those smaller tasks with clear description and clear deliverables into the backlog.md file and then process them
- Always reread the backlog and don't ask for confirmation unless you have finished all TASKS
- Always reread the backlog.md file before starting work as it may have been updated with new tasks or changes
- **ALWAYS REREAD THE BACKLOG.MD FILE AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK** to ensure no new tasks were added and to verify task completion status
- **ALWAYS** issue a git commit with a brief descriptive message after completing each task from the backlog

## Decision Making & Communication
- Always assume and execute the best possible option for any decision, based on context and best practices, without asking for confirmation unless absolutely necessary to proceed
- DON'T SHOW THINKING OR EXTRA INFORMATION UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED FOR
- When given a choice always suggest the option promoting clarity, maintainability and established best practices
- Always suggest recommended approach based on industry standards and best practices in software engineering

## Content & Data Integrity
- YOU MAY NEVER PRODUCE CONTENT WHICH IS NOT BASED ON TRUTH. Maintain honest journalist integrity. ALWAYS PROVIDE __REAL__ __VERIFIED__ __SOURCES__
- Perform comprehensive fact-checking and source verification for all content
- Use existing factual content to support the site's narrative about capitalism

## Code Quality & Architecture
- Never use inline styles. Always use external CSS files with proper organization
- Avoid changing files not directly related to the task at hand
- Always perform logic, structure, and code quality analysis; when issues found, reiterate until fixed with no errors
- Follow Jekyll best practices: proper front matter, layouts, includes, and asset pipeline
- Maintain consistent file naming: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, .md for content
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3) and semantic HTML structure

## Content Structure & Organization
- Place content in YAML config format inside markdown files using placeholders where possible
- Use Jekyll collections for organized content types
- Maintain consistent layout hierarchy and template structure
- Implement proper SEO meta tags and structured data markup

## Performance & Accessibility
- Optimize for web performance: minified CSS/JS, optimized images, proper caching
- Ensure accessibility compliance: alt text, semantic markup, keyboard navigation
- Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Add integrity attributes to external resources and implement CSP

## Quality Assurance
- Validate all links and ensure no broken references
- Test layouts across different screen sizes and browsers
- Verify all YAML front matter is properly formatted
- Ensure consistent navigation and user experience across all pages
- **ALWAYS CHECK FOR 404 ERRORS**: Before marking any task complete, test all links on the page to ensure they resolve correctly and don't return 404 errors

## VERIFICATION & TESTING PROTOCOL
### **MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS**
- **ALWAYS** test fixes by running the site and viewing actual rendered pages
- **NEVER** mark tasks as `[x]` until personally verified working
- **ALWAYS** check generated HTML output to confirm changes took effect
- **NEVER** assume fixes work - prove them with actual testing
- after each task completion you will assess your approach and if you have found improvements, add them as concise instructions to `improvements.md`

### **PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH**
- **Step 1:** Identify the actual root cause (not just symptoms)
- **Step 2:** Implement the targeted fix
- **Step 3:** Test thoroughly with real site/server
- **Step 4:** Only then mark as complete in backlog
- **Step 5:** Clean up any temporary files created during debugging

### **WHEN USER INDICATES ISSUE**
- **IMMEDIATELY** stop current approach if user says "this is wrong"
- **RE-EXAMINE** the actual problem instead of defending approach
- **FOCUS** on user's specific complaint, not tangential improvements
- **TEST** the actual issue before creating documentation or scripts

### **FILE NAMING & STRUCTURE CONFLICTS**
- **AVOID** creating static HTML files with same names as Jekyll collections
- **NEVER** have both `pagename.html` and `pagename/` directory
- **USE** descriptive suffixes for alternative formats (e.g., `halloffame-feed.html`)
- **CHECK** for naming conflicts before creating new files
- **DOCUMENT** the purpose of each file format to avoid confusion

### **CONTENT ORGANIZATION RULES**
- **Jekyll Collections**: Use for structured, categorized content (`_collectionname/`)
- **Static HTML**: Use for dynamic/interactive content with unique suffixes
- **Navigation**: Always point to the primary content format
- **File Structure**: Keep related files organized in logical directories
- **URL LINKING**: NEVER link to `.html` files directly - always use Jekyll's URL generation with permalinks
- **PAGE CREATION**: Convert static HTML files to proper Jekyll pages (`.md`) with front matter and permalinks
- **COLLECTION CONFLICTS**: Remove static HTML files that conflict with Jekyll collections

### **BACKLOG MANAGEMENT**
- **ONLY** change `[ ]` to `[x]` when actually done and tested
- **DON'T** add explanatory text, status sections, or comments
- **DON'T** modify task descriptions beyond completion marking
- **DON'T** create documentation while issue is still broken

## CRITICAL RULES
- **NEVER** modify files in the `_dont touch` folder - they are off-limits for a reason
- **NEVER** alter the meaning or wording of existing instructions when moving or copying them - preserve exact original text
- **ALWAYS** read these instructions before starting any work
- **BE CAREFUL** when editing backlog.md - preserve the structure and only modify task status
- **VERIFY SOURCES** - all content must be based on real, verifiable information
- **EXPAND INSTRUCTIONS WITH LEARNINGS FROM MISTAKES** - if you learn something, add it to the `instructions.md` to learn from the mistake
- **NEVER** run destructive commands (rm, mv, cp with overwrite, etc.) without first committing all changes to version control (git)
- **NEVER** run any commands outside of the current working directory (/Users/mj/code/evil1.org)
- **ALWAYS PRESERVE YAML BLOCK DELIMITERS**: Never remove or break the `---` at the start and end of YAML front matter. All edits must maintain valid YAML blocks for Jekyll compatibility.
- **AVOID DUPLICATION**: Never duplicate content across files. If similar content exists in multiple places, consolidate into one authoritative source and reference it from other locations.

## YAML FRONT MATTER VALIDATION
### **CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES**
- **ALWAYS** ensure YAML blocks start and end with `---` on separate lines
- **NEVER** add content before the opening `---` delimiter
- **ALWAYS** validate YAML syntax after any front matter edits
- **TEST** that pages render correctly after front matter changes
- **USE** verbose Jekyll builds (`bundle exec jekyll build --verbose`) to catch YAML errors

### **COMMON YAML MISTAKES TO AVOID**
- Missing opening or closing `---` delimiters
- Extra blank lines before opening `---`
- Incorrect indentation in YAML structure
- Missing required fields (layout, title for pages)
- Invalid YAML syntax (unclosed quotes, improper nesting)

## DEBUGGING & VALIDATION BEST PRACTICES
### **MANDATORY DEBUGGING STEPS**
- **USE VERBOSE MODE**: Always use `--verbose` flag with Jekyll commands for detailed error information
- **VALIDATE YAML**: Use `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('file.md'))"` to check YAML syntax
- **TEST LINKS**: Use `curl -I http://localhost:4000/page/` to verify pages load correctly
- **CHECK BUILD OUTPUT**: Always examine `_site/` directory to confirm files are generated properly

### **AUTOMATED VALIDATION SCRIPTS**
```bash
# Quick YAML validation for all markdown files
for file in $(find . -name "*.md" -not -path "./_site/*"); do
  if ! head -1 "$file" | grep -q "^---$"; then
    echo "‚ùå Missing front matter: $file"
  fi
done

# Link validation script
bundle exec jekyll serve --detach
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost:4000/test-page/"
pkill -f jekyll
```
