# INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANT

## Task Management
- After task completion mark the task complete like that: [x]
- Should a task need splitting into smaller tasks, add those smaller tasks with clear description and clear deliverables into the backlog.md file and then process them
- Always reread the backlog and don't ask for confirmation unless you have finished all TASKS
- Always reread the backlog.md file before starting work as it may have been updated with new tasks or changes
- **ALWAYS REREAD THE BACKLOG.MD FILE AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK** to ensure no new tasks were added and to verify task completion status

## Decision Making & Communication
- Always assume and execute the best possible option for any decision, based on context and best practices, without asking for confirmation unless absolutely necessary to proceed
- DON'T SHOW THINKING OR EXTRA INFORMATION UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED FOR
- When given a choice always suggest the option promoting clarity, maintainability and established best practices
- Always suggest recommended approach based on industry standards and best practices in software engineering

## Content & Data Integrity
- YOU MAY NEVER PRODUCE CONTENT WHICH IS NOT BASED ON TRUTH. Maintain honest journalist integrity. ALWAYS PROVIDE __REAL__ __VERIFIED__ __SOURCES__
- Perform comprehensive fact-checking and source verification for all content
- Use existing factual content to support the site's narrative about capitalism

## Code Quality & Architecture
- Never use inline styles. Always use external CSS files with proper organization
- Avoid changing files not directly related to the task at hand
