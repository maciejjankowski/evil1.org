                <p><strong>Yes, this site is brought up to you by a real human, yet all the contents are AI generated in a satirical tone oozing with dark humor.</strong> It is done in such way to prevent defamation lawsuits, because after all it's non-copyrightable AI. The mission is real, the effort is real. Raising awareness, translating corporate newspeak into what it really is. Yes, you could contact the authors through secure channels in the future. For now we are fundraising to make this lift off. All money is being transparently accounted for and in the future you'll be able to vote on how to spend it.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>At <span class="highlight">evil1.org</span>, we believe that <span class="highlight">transparency is the ultimate weapon</span> against systemic corruption. Our platform is dedicated to exposing the intricate web of <span class="highlight">recursive capitalism</span> - the self-reinforcing system where corporate power begets more corporate power, where regulators become the regulated, and where democracy serves the shareholder rather than the citizen.</p>

                <p>We are not just another whistleblower platform or corporate watchdog. We are a comprehensive intelligence network that connects the dots between corporate boardrooms, political influence, regulatory capture, and the everyday impact on society. Our mission is to dismantle the illusion of corporate benevolence and reveal the <span class="highlight">recursive nature of capitalist exploitation</span>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What is Recursive Capitalism?</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p><span class="highlight">Recursive capitalism</span> is the phenomenon where wealth and power concentrate in ever-tightening cycles. It's not just about rich people getting richer - it's about the system itself becoming more efficient at extracting value while becoming less accountable to democratic oversight.</p>

                <p>Key characteristics of recursive capitalism include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Capture:</strong> Industries write their own rules through lobbying and revolving-door employment</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Interlocks:</strong> Corporate directors serve on multiple boards, creating incestuous relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Donations:</strong> Campaign financing that ensures favorable legislation</li>
                    <li><strong>Media Consolidation:</strong> News organizations owned by the same corporations they cover</li>
                    <li><strong>Supply Chain Exploitation:</strong> Global networks that maximize profit while minimizing accountability</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
