TASK_FILE="task-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S').md"
cat > "$TASK_FILE" << EOF
# Task: $TASK_DESCRIPTION
**Started:** $TIMESTAMP
**Status:** In Progress

## Task Details
- **Description:** $TASK_DESCRIPTION
- **Complexity Assessment:** [High/Medium/Low - to be determined]
- **Recommended Model:** [GPT-4.1/Grok Code Fast 1/GPT-4o/GPT-5 mini/Gemini 2.5 Pro - to be selected]

## Model Selection Reasoning
[Document why the selected model was chosen for this task]

## Backlog Reference
- Tasks are now tracked in simplified format: `| STATUS | TASK_ID | TASK_DESCRIPTION | MODEL | DoD`
- Check `_docs/backlog-all.md` for current task priorities
- Use `./scripts/mark-task-done.sh TASK_ID` when complete

## Execution Notes
[Document the work performed and any issues encountered]

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Changes tested thoroughly
- [ ] Links verified (no 404 errors)
- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] YAML syntax validated

## Completion
**Completed:** [Timestamp]
**Model Used:** [Actual model used: GPT-4.1/Grok Code Fast 1/GPT-4o/GPT-5 mini/Gemini 2.5 Pro]
**Time Taken:** [Duration]
**Success:** [Yes/No/Partial]
**Notes:** [Any additional observations or learnings]
