# EVIL1.ORG Business Model Validation Framework

**Document Status**: Active Testing Protocol  
**Timeline**: Q1-Q2 2025 (Validation Phase)  
**Target**: Validate $100K ARR pathway through controlled experiments  
**Last Updated**: January 27, 2025  

## Executive Summary

This framework provides systematic validation experiments to test the viability of our monetization strategy before full-scale investment. Rather than betting everything on a single approach, we'll run parallel experiments to validate market demand, pricing sensitivity, and operational feasibility across multiple revenue streams.

### Core Validation Principle
**"Test small, fail fast, scale what works"** - Each experiment is designed to validate specific assumptions with minimal investment and maximum learning.
