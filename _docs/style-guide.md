# Editorial Style Guide

**Last Updated:** {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

This comprehensive style guide ensures consistent, high-quality content across all evil1.org publications. It covers tone, formatting, fact-checking, citations, and editorial workflow.

## Core Principles

### Mission Alignment
All content must align with our mission: **Exposing corporate evil and capitalist exploitation through satirical social networking**. Every article should:
- Critique power structures and corporate malfeasance
- Use dark humor and satire to highlight systemic issues
- Maintain journalistic integrity while being accessible
- Focus on accountability and systemic change

### Tone Guidelines

#### Primary Tone: Satirical Critique
- **Dark Humor**: Use irony and sarcasm to expose hypocrisy
- **Sharp Wit**: Employ clever wordplay and cultural references
- **Moral Clarity**: Never equivocate on corporate wrongdoing
- **Hopeful Anger**: Critique with purpose, not nihilism

#### Voice Characteristics
- **Confident**: Speak with authority on corporate corruption
- **Accessible**: Avoid jargon; explain complex topics clearly
- **Engaging**: Hook readers with compelling narratives
- **Uncompromising**: Call out evil without fear or favor

#### Examples
✅ **Good**: "JPMorgan's 'philanthropy' budget exceeds their fines for money laundering. Because nothing says 'giving back' like not getting caught."

❌ **Bad**: "JPMorgan has been involved in some controversial activities."
