# Dark Patterns Strategy: Satirical Corporate Manipulation Tactics

**Date:** September 13, 2025  
**Concept:** Self-Aware Corporate Evil Through UX Exploitation  
**Tagline:** "Every Click is a Trick: Mastering the Art of User Exploitation for Satirical Purposes"

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive strategy outlines how Evil1.org can implement dark patterns—manipulative UX design tactics—to satirically expose and mock the predatory mechanisms of modern capitalism. By deploying these patterns with transparent self-awareness, we create a meta-commentary on corporate exploitation while generating maximum engagement and revenue.

**Core Philosophy:** *"We manipulate you into understanding how you're being manipulated everywhere else."*

## 1. Dark Patterns Taxonomy & Corporate Origins

### 1.1 The Corporate Dark Pattern Arsenal

#### **Forced Continuity**
- **Corporate Usage:** Subscription traps, auto-renewals without clear notice
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** "Capitalism Exposure Subscription" with increasingly dramatic cancellation warnings
- **Satirical Twist:** Each cancellation attempt shows deeper levels of corporate evil you'll miss

#### **Roach Motel**
- **Corporate Usage:** Easy to get in, impossible to get out (hotel booking sites, subscription services)
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** "Corporate Evil Research Portal" - easy signup, comically difficult exit
- **Satirical Twist:** Exit process includes "moral cleansing questionnaire" and guilt trips

#### **Privacy Zuckering**
- **Corporate Usage:** Tricking users into sharing more data than intended
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** "Evil Personality Assessment" that gradually extracts personal details
- **Satirical Twist:** Results reveal how much data you've shared, educating about privacy exploitation

#### **Bait and Switch**
- **Corporate Usage:** Advertising one thing, delivering another
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** "Free Corporate Evil Report" leads to premium membership offers
- **Satirical Twist:** Clear labeling that this is exactly what corporations do

#### **Confirmshaming**
- **Corporate Usage:** Making users feel bad for declining offers
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** Declining newsletter signup shows "I prefer to remain ignorant about corporate crimes"
- **Satirical Twist:** Options become increasingly dramatic and self-aware

#### **Scarcity Manipulation**
- **Corporate Usage:** False urgency and limited availability
- **Evil1.org Implementation:** "Only 17 Spots Left in Corporate Evil Masterclass!"
- **Satirical Twist:** Counter resets daily, openly mocking artificial scarcity

## 2. Site-Wide Dark Pattern Implementation Strategy

### 2.1 Navigation & Onboarding Patterns

#### **The Corporate Evil Funnel**
```
Entry Point → Engagement Trap → Data Extraction → Conversion → Retention Prison
```

**Homepage Dark Patterns:**
- **Attention Grabbing Banner:** "BREAKING: Your Company is Probably Evil (Click to Find Out How Much)"
- **False Urgency Timer:** "Corporate Evil Exposure Limited Time: 23:59:58"
- **Social Proof Manipulation:** "Join 50,847 people who've discovered their corporate overlords' crimes"

**Navigation Manipulation:**
- **Bait Categories:** "Free Resources" leads to premium content previews
- **Mislabeling:** "Contact Us" button labeled "Report Corporate Crimes"
- **Hidden Exits:** Unsubscribe links buried in "Corporate Compliance" section

### 2.2 Content Engagement Patterns

#### **The Curiosity Gap Exploitation**
- **Headlines:** "This One Simple Trick Corporations Don't Want You to Know (It's Actually 47 Tricks)"
- **Content Gating:** "You're 73% through this article. Unlock the shocking conclusion with membership!"
- **Cliffhanger Sections:** Each article ends with "But the REAL scandal starts in Part 2..."

#### **Emotional Manipulation Ladder**
1. **Shock:** Reveal corporate wrongdoing
2. **Anger:** Show how it affects users personally
3. **Fear:** Imply more undiscovered corruption
4. **Hope:** Offer solution through membership/courses
5. **Guilt:** Suggest inaction enables corporate evil

### 2.3 Merchandise Dark Patterns

#### **The Recursive Purchase Trap**
- **Bundle Manipulation:** "Buy the 'I Hate Consumerism' t-shirt AND get our 'Stop Buying Stuff' tote bag!"
- **Shipping Shame:** Free shipping requires minimum order that "reduces carbon footprint"
- **Cart Abandonment Guilt:** "Your unpurchased anti-capitalist merchandise is contributing to the problem"

#### **Self-Aware Pricing Psychology**
- **Decoy Pricing:** Basic t-shirt $25, "Deluxe Anti-Greed" t-shirt $27, "Premium Wealth Inequality Fighter" t-shirt $75
- **Loss Aversion:** "You're saving $12 by NOT buying our competitor's inferior corporate critique products"
- **Anchoring:** "Compared to a $500 corporate ethics course, our $50 'Corporate Evil Decoder Ring' is a steal!"

---

## 3. Educational Content Dark Patterns

### 3.2 Progress Manipulation

- **Investment Tracking:** "You've spent 14 hours learning corporate crimes. Invest 3 more to become certified!"
