## Usage Examples

### evil1.org Core Voice
> "Amazon calls it 'workforce optimization.' We call it 'making humans work like robots until they break.' Because nothing says 'customer obsession' like obsessing over how to squeeze more productivity from increasingly desperate workers."

### Manhattan Review (New Yorker Style)
> "The evolution from 'environmental destruction' to 'resource development' to 'sustainability leadership' represents a masterclass in linguistic alchemy—the transmutation of ecological catastrophe into corporate virtue through euphemistic refinement."

### Reality Check Daily (Digital Native)
> "TikTok's algorithm doesn't show you content—it performs behavioral modification. When ByteDance calls it 'content optimization,' they mean 'addiction maximization.' That dopamine hit from each scroll isn't accidental; it's engineered."
