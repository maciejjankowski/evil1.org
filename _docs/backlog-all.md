## Next steps
- Review each task and pick the first small task to implement (e.g., T503 image optimization or T502 navigation tweaks).
- For each selected task, create a task document using `scripts/start-task.sh "Short description"` and update this file when complete using `./scripts/mark-task-done.sh TASK_ID`.

### Notes: Image optimization helper
- A helper script `scripts/optimize-images.sh` was added (dry-run by default).
- To preview changes locally run: `./scripts/optimize-images.sh` (no changes).
- To apply optimizations after confirming, install `jpegoptim`/`pngquant` or ImageMagick and run:
	`./scripts/optimize-images.sh --apply --quality 85`

### Current work
- T502 is the active next task to work on (site-wide navigation improvements). A task document will be created and a starter include added in `_includes/breadcrumbs.html`.
