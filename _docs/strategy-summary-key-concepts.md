## The Meta-Paradox Strategy

**Core Philosophy:** Use capitalism to critique capitalism by becoming an exaggerated version of what we criticize, making the critique impossible to ignore.

**Every revenue stream is simultaneously:**
- Genuinely profitable (real money from real services)
- Satirically brilliant (each transaction critiques itself)
- Educationally valuable (people learn by participating)
- Systemically subversive (uses the system against itself)

## Risk Mitigation

**The Success Paradox:** We might become actually evil while satirizing evil
- **Solution:** Document our own corruption as part of the content
- **Backup:** "Reformed evil corporation" narrative

**Ultimate Product:** When we become corporate overlords, we'll sell the story: "How We Became What We Hated: A Corporate Evil Origin Story"
