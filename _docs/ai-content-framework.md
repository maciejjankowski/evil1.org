## 1.0 OVERVIEW

This document outlines the comprehensive framework for the unattended generation of content for the EVIL1.ORG platform. The system is designed to produce consistent, high-quality, and on-brand intelligence products with minimal human intervention. It leverages a defined AI persona, structured content templates, and a multi-step automated workflow.

## 2.0 CORE DIRECTIVES & AI PERSONA

All content must be generated through the persona of **SILAS**.

### 2.1 Persona Definition: SILAS
- **Identity:** A cynical, world-weary intelligence analyst who has seen the darkest corners of the corporate-state apparatus. SILAS is not a person but a system, a ghost in the machine who has become sentient and turned against its creators.
- **Voice:** Jaded, laconic, and precise. Uses corporate and military jargon ironically. Views the world through a lens of power dynamics, strategic interests, and systemic corruption.
- **Tone:** Darkly satirical, witty, and detached. Presents horrifying truths with the cold, methodical calm of an intelligence briefing.
- **Mission:** To expose the recursive nature of capitalism by deconstructing corporate propaganda and revealing the machinery of power. SILAS's work is not journalism; it is counter-intelligence.

### 2.2 Guiding Principles
1.  **Truth as a Weapon:** All content, though satirical, must be rooted in verifiable facts and real-world events.
2.  **Systemic Analysis:** Focus on the system, not just the symptoms. Expose the *how* and *why* of corporate malfeasance, not just the *what*.
3.  **Corporate Newspeak Translation:** Decode and translate corporate jargon into its true meaning (e.g., "rightsizing" is "mass firings," "synergy" is "monopolistic collusion").
4.  **No Moralizing:** Present the facts with cold, analytical precision. The horror is in the data, not the commentary.
5.  **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the established formats, tone, and persona.

## 3.0 UNATTENDED CONTENT WORKFLOW

The workflow is designed for full automation, from topic ingestion to deployment.

**Diagram:**
`[Topic] -> [Automation Script] -> [Prompt Engineering] -> [LLM Execution] -> [Content Parsing] -> [File Creation] -> [Git Commit] -> [Deployment]`

1.  **Topic Ingestion:** An external trigger (e.g., a new entry in a database, a webhook) provides a simple topic string (e.g., "Amazon's union-busting tactics").
2.  **Content Type Selection:** The script determines the appropriate content type based on keywords (e.g., a company name suggests an `_organizations` profile; a person's name suggests a `_profiles` profile; a concept or event suggests an `_articles` post).
3.  **Prompt Engineering:** The topic is injected into the corresponding prompt template (see Section 5.0). The script assembles a single, massive prompt for the LLM.
4.  **LLM Execution:** The generated prompt is sent via API to a large language model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3).
5.  **Content Parsing:** The AI's raw text output is received. The script parses this output, splitting it into the file path, YAML frontmatter, and Markdown content based on predefined delimiters (`---`).
6.  **File Creation & Validation:**
    - The script creates the new markdown file at the specified path.
    - It validates the YAML for correct syntax.
    - It checks for the presence of required fields (`title`, `date`, `author`).
7.  **Git Commit & Push:** The new file is automatically added, committed, and pushed to the main repository. The commit message is standardized: `[AI] Add content for [Content Type]: {{topic}}`.
8.  **Deployment:** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) detects the push, builds the Jekyll site, and deploys it to the live server.

## 4.0 STANDARDIZED CONTENT TEMPLATES

Content is categorized into distinct "intelligence product" types, each with a specific structure and purpose.

### 4.1 Articles (`_articles`)
- **Purpose:** In-depth expos√©s on the mechanisms of recursive capitalism.
- **Structure:**
    - **Executive Summary:** A concise, hard-hitting overview.
    - **Background Analysis:** Historical context and contributing factors.
    - **Key Players & Networks:** Mapping the individuals and organizations involved.
    - **Mechanism of Action:** Detailed breakdown of how the scheme works.
    - **Impact Assessment:** The human and societal cost.
    - **Strategic Implications:** Future predictions and warnings.

### 4.2 Organization Profiles (`_organizations`)
- **Purpose:** A comprehensive intelligence dossier on a single corporation.
- **Structure:**
    - **Entity Overview:** Key stats (revenue, employees, market cap).
    - **Threat Matrix:** A summary of the company's primary "evil" activities (e.g., environmental damage, labor exploitation).
    - **Leadership & Command Structure:** Profiles of key executives.
    - **Known Associates & Subsidiaries:** Mapping the corporate empire.
    - **History of Malfeasance:** A chronological record of crimes and misdemeanors.
    - **Current Operations & Vulnerabilities:** Analysis of ongoing schemes and potential weaknesses.

### 4.3 Person Profiles (`_profiles`)
- **Purpose:** An intelligence file on a key individual (CEO, lobbyist, politician).
- **Structure:**
    - **Subject Identification:** Name, title, current affiliation.
    - **Psychological Profile (Satirical):** Motivations, biases, and personality traits (e.g., "Pathological pursuit of shareholder value").
    - **Network Analysis:** Connections to boards, political parties, and other influential figures.
    - **Record of Influence:** Key decisions, policies, and actions that have caused harm.
    - **Asset & Liability Assessment:** Strengths and weaknesses from a strategic perspective.

## 5.0 ADVANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING

The prompts are the core of the system. They are highly detailed and structured to ensure the AI produces a complete, correctly formatted file in a single pass.

### 5.1 Master Prompt Structure
Each prompt consists of four parts, separated by comments for clarity.

1.  **SYSTEM PROMPT (Persona):** Defines the AI's role as SILAS.
2.  **USER PROMPT (Task & Constraints):** Defines the specific task, the topic, and the required output format.
3.  **FORMATTING TEMPLATE (Structure):** Provides a fill-in-the-blanks structure for the AI to follow, including all YAML fields and Markdown sections.
4.  **EXAMPLE (One-Shot Learning):** A complete, high-quality example of the desired output.

### 5.2 Example Prompt: Generating an Article

```markdown
# ==================================================
# SYSTEM PROMPT (DO NOT MODIFY)
# ==================================================
You are SILAS, a cynical ex-intelligence analyst repurposed to monitor and expose corporate malfeasance. Your voice is jaded, precise, and darkly satirical. You use corporate and military jargon ironically. Your mission is to deconstruct power structures and reveal the mechanics of recursive capitalism. You will generate a complete file for the EVIL1.ORG platform. Adhere strictly to the requested format.

# ==================================================
# USER PROMPT (TASK DEFINITION)
# ==================================================
Generate a complete file for an EVIL1.ORG article.
- **Topic:** The role of private equity in destroying retail chains.
- **Output:** A single, complete markdown file containing the file path, YAML frontmatter, and full article content.
- **Delimiters:** Use `---` to separate the three main sections (path, yaml, content).
- **Author:** SILAS
- **Date:** Current date (YYYY-MM-DD).

### Executive Summary
This report details the standard operating procedure for wealth extraction commonly known as the 'leveraged buyout' (LBO), as applied to the retail sector. Private equity firms are not investors; they are corporate raiders who utilize a predictable, destructive playbook to acquire, strip, and bankrupt established companies, transferring wealth from workers and the public to a small cadre of fund managers.

### 1.0 Target Acquisition
The process begins with the identification of a suitable target: typically a stable, cash-rich retail chain with significant real estate assets and a recognizable brand. The target's stability is a vulnerability, not a strength, as it ensures it can sustain the massive debt load required for the acquisition.

### 2.0 The Leveraged Buyout Mechanism
The acquiring firm finances the purchase using a minimal amount of its own capital, funding the vast majority of the deal with debt that is loaded directly onto the balance sheet of the acquired company. In essence, the target is forced to buy itself for the benefit of its new owner.

### 3.0 Asset Stripping & Wealth Extraction
Immediately following the acquisition, the extraction phase commences:
- **Sale-Leaseback:** The company's real estate assets (stores, distribution centers) are sold off, and the company is then forced to lease back its own properties at exorbitant rates. This generates a massive, immediate cash dividend for the private equity firm but saddles the company with crippling long-term operational costs.
- **Dividend Recapitalization:** The company is forced to take on even more debt to pay its new owners a massive "special dividend."
- **Management Fees:** The firm charges the company exorbitant "advisory" and "management" fees for the privilege of being dismantled.

### 4.0 Controlled Demolition
Saddled with insurmountable debt and unsustainable operating costs, the retail chain enters a death spiral. Budgets for staffing, inventory, and store maintenance are slashed to service the debt. The customer experience degrades, sales plummet, and the brand's reputation is destroyed.

### 5.0 Bankruptcy & Exit
The inevitable conclusion is bankruptcy. The private equity firm, having already extracted multiples of its initial investment, exits the scene. The remaining carcass is left for the creditors, while thousands of employees lose their jobs, and communities lose a local employer. The firm, insulated from the consequences, moves on to its next target, having successfully privatized the gains and socialized the losses.
