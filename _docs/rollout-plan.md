# Go-Live Rollout Plan

This document outlines the incremental rollout plan for evil1.org, designed to build momentum, gather feedback, and ensure a successful public launch.

## Phase 1: Stealth Mode (Current State)

**Objective:** Complete core development, content creation, and internal testing.

- **Activities:**
  - Develop all core site features (Jekyll setup, layouts, collections).
  - Create initial content for articles, profiles, and merchandise.
  - Perform internal testing for functionality, performance, and visual consistency.
  - Set up analytics and monitoring tools.
- **Goal:** A fully functional site ready for a limited audience.

## Phase 2: Teaser Mode (Pre-Launch)

**Objective:** Generate buzz and capture a pre-launch subscriber base.

- **Activities:**
  - Launch a temporary, teaser homepage (`index.html`) with:
    - A countdown timer to the public launch.
    - Snippets of "coming soon" content.
    - A prominent email subscription form.
  - Start a coordinated social media campaign with teaser content.
  - Rename the full homepage to `index.full.markdown` to preserve it for the public launch.
- **Goal:** Build an email list of at least 1,000 interested users before public launch.

## Phase 3: Early Access (Invite-Only Beta)

**Objective:** Gather user feedback and identify critical issues before the full launch.

- **Activities:**
  - Send exclusive invitations to a segment of the pre-launch subscriber list.
  - Grant access to a portion of the site's content (e.g., 3-5 full articles, a few company profiles).
  - Implement a feedback mechanism (e.g., a simple form or dedicated email).
  - Monitor analytics for user behavior and identify any technical issues.
- **Goal:** Identify and fix at least 10 major bugs or usability issues based on real user feedback.

## Phase 4: Public Launch (Go-Live)

**Objective:** Launch the full site to the public and maximize initial impact.

- **Activities:**
  - Replace the teaser homepage with the full homepage (`index.full.markdown`).
  - Announce the launch to the full email subscriber list.
  - Execute a full marketing and PR push.
  - Reveal all initial content.
- **Goal:** Achieve 10,000 unique visitors in the first week.

## Phase 5: Post-Launch Iteration

**Objective:** Maintain momentum with ongoing content and community engagement.

- **Activities:**
  - Begin a regular content publishing schedule.
  - Actively engage with the community on social media and the site.
  - Use analytics to identify popular content and inform future strategy.
  - Plan and develop new features based on user feedback.
- **Goal:** Establish a weekly content release schedule and grow the community by 10% month-over-month.
