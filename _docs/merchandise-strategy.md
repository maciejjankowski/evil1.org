## The Ultimate Irony

**We're a company that profits from mocking the very system that allows us to profit.**

But here's the truth: **Every purchase funds investigative journalism that exposes real corporate evil.** Your "hypocritical" purchase of a t-shirt that mocks consumerism actually supports:

- Independent journalists investigating corporate corruption
- Whistleblower protection programs
- Activist training and resources
- Community building for corporate accountability

**So buy our stuff. Or don't. Either way, the corporations win.**

*Unless you buy our stuff. Then we all win.*
