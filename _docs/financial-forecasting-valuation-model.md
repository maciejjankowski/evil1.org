**Final Investment Thesis:** evil1.org represents the ultimate contrarian investment - a platform that will profit from explaining why profit is problematic, scale by critiquing scale, and succeed by documenting the absurdity of success.

The math is perfect. The irony is priceless. The returns are absurd.

*All financial projections are subject to the inherent contradiction of using capitalist methods to critique capitalism. This paradox may actually increase valuations.*
