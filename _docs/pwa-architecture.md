# Progressive Web App (PWA) Feature Plan

**Task:** T407 | Implement relevant progressive web app features to maximize user retention and stickability
**Model:** GPT-4.1
**Definition of Done:** Design app architecture, implement push notifications, etc.

## Goals
- Maximize user retention and engagement
- Enable installability and offline access
- Support push notifications for updates and engagement
- Improve performance and reliability

## Key Features
1. **Service Worker**
   - Caching strategies for offline access
   - Asset precaching and runtime caching
   - Network fallback for reliability
2. **Web App Manifest**
   - App name, icons, theme color, display mode
   - Enable "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. **Push Notifications**
   - Integration with browser push APIs
   - Opt-in UI for users
   - Example notification triggers (new article, breaking news, membership offers)
4. **Installability**
   - Manifest and service worker requirements
   - Custom install prompt for desktop/mobile
5. **Offline Fallbacks**
   - Custom offline page for content
   - Graceful error handling
6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Asset minification and lazy loading
   - Fast load times for repeat visitors

## Implementation Steps
1. Add `manifest.json` to site root and reference in HTML head
2. Add `service-worker.js` to site root and register in main layout
3. Implement basic caching and offline fallback in service worker
4. Integrate push notification opt-in and example triggers
5. Add install prompt logic and test across browsers
6. Document all changes and update backlog
