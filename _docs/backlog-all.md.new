# BACKLOG-ALL: single source of truth (auto-generated)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file is the consolidated backlog and the single source of truth for
# task tracking. Do not edit manually above the tasks section. To regenerate
# the consolidated backlog run:
#
#   ./scripts/consolidate-backlogs.sh
#
# Backups are created by `scripts/backup-backlog.sh` (recommended before
# regenerating).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CI: A GitHub Action will run `scripts/backup-backlog.sh` and
# `scripts/consolidate-backlogs.sh` on push or manual dispatch to keep this
# file up to date (`.github/workflows/backlog-regenerate.yml`).

## Next steps
- Review each task and pick the first small task to implement (e.g., T503 image optimization or T502 navigation tweaks).
- For each selected task, create a task document using `scripts/start-task.sh "Short description"` and update this file when complete using `./scripts/mark-task-done.sh TASK_ID`.

### Notes: Image optimization helper
- A helper script `scripts/optimize-images.sh` exists in the repo (dry-run by default).
- To preview changes locally run: `./scripts/optimize-images.sh` (no changes).
- To apply optimizations after confirming, install `jpegoptim`/`pngquant` or ImageMagick and run:
	`./scripts/optimize-images.sh --apply --quality 85`

### Current work
- T502 is the active next task to work on (site-wide navigation improvements). A task document will be created and a starter include added in `_includes/breadcrumbs.html`.
