# EvilCorp: A Case Study in Corporate Evil

EvilCorp Industries represents everything wrong with modern capitalism. What began as a legitimate manufacturing business has evolved into a predatory empire that prioritizes profit over people, planet, and ethics.

## Business Model

EvilCorp's success is built on three pillars:
1. **Labor Exploitation**: Sweatshop conditions in developing countries
2. **Environmental Destruction**: Systematic pollution and resource depletion
3. **Regulatory Capture**: Millions spent annually on lobbying and campaign contributions

## Impact on Communities

The company's operations have devastated countless communities:
- Contaminated drinking water in 23 cities
- Forced displacement of indigenous populations
- Suppression of union organizing efforts
- Contribution to climate change through fossil fuel investments

## Legal History

EvilCorp has been involved in over 50 major lawsuits, including:
- Environmental violations ($2.3 billion in fines)
- Labor rights violations (multiple class-action suits)
- Antitrust violations (ongoing investigations)
- Securities fraud (settled for $750 million)

## Current Operations

Despite its history, EvilCorp continues to expand aggressively:
- Opening new factories in countries with minimal regulations
- Investing heavily in fossil fuels despite climate commitments
- Lobbying against worker safety and environmental protections

## Conclusion

EvilCorp's story illustrates how unchecked corporate power corrupts absolutely. Their continued profitability demonstrates the urgent need for systemic reform of corporate governance and accountability.
