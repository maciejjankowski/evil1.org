## Mission Statement

The Chutzpah Department is dedicated to developing and deploying industrial-strength audacity in corporate environments. We believe that if you're going to be evil, you should do it with such breathtaking confidence that people almost admire the sheer nerve.

## Core Philosophy

> "Chutzpah is that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan."
> 
> â€” Traditional Definition, Corporate Application Division

We've modernized this concept for the boardroom: Chutzpah is demanding a bailout for the mess you created, then complaining about government regulation.

## Success Stories

**MegaBank's Bailout Bonus Program**
After receiving taxpayer bailouts, our client successfully argued that executive bonuses were necessary for "talent retention." We helped them frame greed as fiscal responsibility and public service.

When caught selling user data, we helped them rebrand surveillance as "personalized experiences" and position privacy violations as innovation. Their "Privacy First" campaign launched the same week they expanded data collection.

**PharmaCorp's Compassion Campaign**
While raising insulin prices 3000%, we helped them launch a "Patient Care Initiative" that provided discount cards requiring patients to jump through hoops that saved the company money compared to lower prices.

**OilEvil's Climate Leadership**
