## Editorial Review Process

All stories published on the wall must:
- Be based on real events and cite reputable sources (news outlets, official reports, etc.)
- Include a direct link to the source article for verification
- Be fact-checked by at least one editor before publication
- Avoid manipulation or hallucination; maintain meaning and integrity
- Use sarcasm only when the underlying facts are accurate

Editors are responsible for:
- Reviewing each submission for factual accuracy
- Ensuring links are valid and point to real sources
- Rejecting any content that cannot be verified

This process ensures honest journalism and maintains the highest standards of integrity, even when the tone is satirical.
