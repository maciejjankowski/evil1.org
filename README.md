## Development Workflow

This project uses an intelligent Copilot model selection system for optimal task completion. Before starting any work:

1. **Read the instructions**: `instructions.md` contains all guidelines and Copilot model selection criteria
2. **Follow the workflow**: `workflow.md` provides the complete development process with model selection
3. **Check the backlog**: `backlog.md` contains current tasks and priorities
4. **Review improvements**: `improvements.md` documents lessons learned and best practices

### Copilot Model Selection

Choose the appropriate model based on task complexity:

- **GPT-4**: Complex debugging, Jekyll configuration, build issues, technical analysis
- **GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Routine tasks, simple edits, basic validation, quick fixes
- **Claude**: Content creation, documentation, ethical content, narrative writing

See `workflow.md` for detailed model selection guidelines and `instructions.md` for complete model capabilities.

## Editorial Review Process

All stories published on the wall must:
- Be based on real events and cite reputable sources (news outlets, official reports, etc.)
- Include a direct link to the source article for verification
- Be fact-checked by at least one editor before publication
- Avoid manipulation or hallucination; maintain meaning and integrity
- Use sarcasm only when the underlying facts are accurate

Editors are responsible for:
- Reviewing each submission for factual accuracy
- Ensuring links are valid and point to real sources
- Rejecting any content that cannot be verified

This process ensures honest journalism and maintains the highest standards of integrity, even when the tone is satirical.
