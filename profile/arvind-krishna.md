# Arvind Krishna: The Mainframe Monarch

## From Research to Revenue Extraction

Arvind Krishna took over IBM during its decline and positioned it as an AI and cloud services company. His leadership represents the ultimate corporate pivot: repackage old technology as "AI" and charge premium prices for basic services.

## The Mainframe Monopoly
IBM maintains control over legacy mainframe systems used by banks and governments. The company charges exorbitant maintenance fees for outdated technology, creating a captive market of dependency.

## The Cloud Profiteering
IBM's cloud services are priced at premium levels while offering basic functionality. The company acquired Red Hat to gain open source credibility, then proceeded to monetize it aggressively.

## The AI Marketing Machine
IBM markets "Watson" as revolutionary AI, but it's primarily a rebranded collection of existing technologies. Krishna uses AI hype to justify high prices and maintain market position.

## The Consulting Empire
IBM's consulting division charges hundreds of thousands per consultant while often providing basic services. The company has been accused of overbilling and providing substandard work.

## The Pension Fund Raid
IBM has underfunded its pension obligations while paying billions in dividends and buybacks. Krishna continues this practice, prioritizing shareholder returns over employee security.

## The Executive Pay
Krishna earned $21 million in 2022, including stock awards. His compensation is tied to IBM's stock performance, which benefits from maintaining high prices rather than innovation.
