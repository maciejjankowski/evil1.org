# Lisa Su: The Chip Warrior

## From Engineer to Empire Builder

Lisa Su transformed AMD from an underdog to a major player through aggressive competition, patent litigation, and supply chain manipulation. Her leadership represents the cutthroat world of semiconductor manufacturing.

## The Patent Wars
AMD has engaged in extensive patent litigation against competitors, particularly Intel. Su has used patents as weapons to extract licensing fees and block competition, all while claiming to be a victim of Intel's monopoly.

## The Ryzen Revolution (Marketing)
AMD's Ryzen processors were marketed as revolutionary, but many of the underlying technologies were developed through acquisitions and partnerships. Su positioned AMD as an innovator while building on others' work.

## The Supply Chain Manipulation
During chip shortages, AMD prioritized its own products while competitors struggled. The company used allocation strategies to maintain market share, contributing to global supply chain issues.

## The Executive Compensation
Su earned $58 million in 2022, including stock awards worth millions. Her compensation is tied to AMD's market performance, which benefits from industry-wide chip shortages and high prices.

## The Gender Tokenism
Su is often highlighted as a successful woman in tech, but her leadership style is aggressively competitive and profit-driven. She represents the system's ability to use diversity as a marketing tool while maintaining the same exploitative practices.
