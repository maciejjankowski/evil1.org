# Albert Small Jr.: The Pfizer Profiteer

## From Operations to Outrageous Profits

Albert Small Jr. took over Pfizer during the COVID-19 pandemic and turned it into the most profitable pharmaceutical company in history. His leadership represents the ultimate healthcare exploitation: profit from pandemics while charging extortionate prices.

## The COVID-19 Profiteering
Pfizer charged $20 billion for COVID-19 vaccines developed with taxpayer money. Small used government funding and Operation Warp Speed to create record profits while maintaining high drug prices.

## The Patent Monopoly Abuse
Pfizer uses patent protections to maintain monopolies on essential drugs, charging hundreds of times the manufacturing cost. Small's company has been accused of evergreening patents to extend monopolies.

## The Price Gouging Empire
Pfizer charges the highest prices for insulin and other essential drugs in the world. Small claims this is necessary for innovation, but the reality is profit maximization at the expense of human life.

## The Marketing Manipulation
Pfizer uses aggressive marketing and kickbacks to doctors to promote drugs. The company has paid billions in fines for off-label marketing and illegal promotions.

## The Government Contracts
Pfizer receives billions in government contracts while lobbying against drug price controls. Small's company profits from both government subsidies and high prices.

## The Executive Compensation
Small earned $25 million in 2022, including stock awards. His compensation is tied to Pfizer's stock performance, which benefits from maintaining high drug prices.

## The Healthcare Hypocrisy
While charging extortionate prices for life-saving drugs, Small claims Pfizer is committed to healthcare access. The reality is profit over people.
