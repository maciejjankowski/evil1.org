# Bob Iger: The Mouse House Monarch

## From ABC to Absolute Control

Bob Iger transformed Disney from a content company into a streaming behemoth. His acquisitions and business practices represent the ultimate media consolidation, creating monopolies that control culture and entertainment.

## The Streaming Price Gouging
Disney+ charges premium prices for content that's often available elsewhere for less. Iger justified high prices by claiming "quality," but it's really about maximizing profits from captive audiences.

## The Fox Acquisition
Disney's $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox gave it control over massive content libraries. Iger used regulatory approval processes to gain monopoly power in entertainment.

## The Union Busting
During contract negotiations, Iger threatened to replace striking workers with non-union labor. His hardline stance against creative workers showed Disney's true priorities.

## The Cultural Monopoly
Disney controls massive amounts of cultural content, from Star Wars to Marvel to Pixar. Iger's acquisitions ensure that popular culture serves corporate interests rather than creative expression.

## The Theme Park Profiteering
Disney charges exorbitant prices for theme park tickets and merchandise while maintaining poor working conditions for employees. Iger's "magic" comes at the expense of workers and families.

## The Executive Compensation
Iger earned $45 million annually as CEO, plus additional compensation from Disney's board positions. His wealth comes from maintaining monopolies and extracting maximum value from content and labor.
