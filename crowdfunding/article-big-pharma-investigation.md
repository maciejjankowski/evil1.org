## The Investigation

Pharmaceutical price manipulation represents one of the most egregious forms of corporate evil in modern capitalism. This investigation will expose:

### Research Scope
- **Patent Manipulation**: How companies extend monopolies through spurious patent applications
- **Price Coordination**: Evidence of industry-wide price fixing conspiracies
- **Regulatory Capture**: FDA officials' revolving door with pharmaceutical companies
- **International Comparison**: How the same drugs cost 10x more in the US vs Europe

### Exclusive Access
- **Whistleblower Interviews**: Former pharmaceutical executives willing to speak on record
- **Internal Documents**: Leaked pricing strategy memos and board meeting transcripts
- **Financial Analysis**: Deep dive into profit margins and R&D cost justifications
- **Legal Filings**: Analysis of sealed court documents from class-action lawsuits

### Deliverables
- **10,000+ Word Report**: Comprehensive investigation with citations and evidence
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Price trends and profit margin analysis
- **Video Interviews**: Exclusive content with industry insiders
- **Legal Document Archive**: Searchable database of key evidence
- **Policy Recommendations**: Actionable steps for regulatory reform

### Impact
This investigation will provide ammunition for lawmakers, patient advocacy groups, and legal teams pursuing pharmaceutical accountability. Previous investigations have led to congressional hearings and billions in fines.

Contributors will receive early access to findings, exclusive interview footage, and detailed source material not available in the public version.
