# Suggested Reading: Books That Expose Corporate Evil

In a world where corporations write their own rules and fund their own regulators, knowledge is the most dangerous weapon. These books peel back the facade of "free enterprise" to reveal the systematic exploitation, corruption, and human cost of modern capitalism.

Each recommendation comes with our signature satirical analysis - because nothing exposes corporate bullshit quite like a well-placed barb.
