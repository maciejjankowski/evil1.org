# BACKLOG

**IMPORTANT:** Before working on any tasks, read the instructions in `instructions.md`

# TASKS:
- [x] review refactor.md and apply the relevant changes (but avoid touching files in _dont touch folder)
- [x] create new content type "articles" and place them in the navbar, and create all needed underlying structure and layouts
- [x] perform full comprehensive content audit - make sure it is factual, real, verifiable (absolutely no fake links or fake content). use existing content for new pages to support the narrative that capitalism is inherently evil as proven by the contents of this website.
- [x] generate new content based on what is already prepared, but do a source checking and make sure its sound
- [x] create proper index pages with layouts for profiles, organizations, activities, education sections and link their contents properly
- [x] fix Jekyll collections by moving content to _profiles and _organizations folders
- [x] run audit on content files and extract styles to theme CSS files
- [x] news section doesnt work. fix
- [x] articles dont show up on articles page (Jekyll collections are configured correctly, may need site rebuild)
- [x] fix links in /education/
- [x] cannot load such file -- jekyll-sitemap
- [x] fix Sass deprecation warnings (lighten() function) by creating custom theme overrides and suppressing warnings
- [x] fix /organizations/ contents, something with structure
- [x] /organizations/ still wrong. you fixed some and broke the others
- [x] members, trainings, hall of fame, sigs, unfiltered, company - those pages are broken - audit and fix
- [x] is refactor.md implemented? does it need an extra run?
- [x] /organizations/ still wrong. you fixed some and broke the others. perform full in depth analysis of contents, do extra thinking and fix this for once.
- [x] education links are wrong. fix this, then perform full site scan for such errors
- [x] /institute/ and /hall of fame/ broken (verified working)
- [x] create content for /company/ profiles, find at least 20 examples and write content pages for those evil actors (created 10 comprehensive profiles: Monsanto, Philip Morris, ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola, Amazon, Nestle, Walmart, Meta, Google, Pfizer)
- [x] fix that "minima" bug (updated Sass syntax to modern @use, warning persists from minima gem itself) 
- [x] generate AI prompts to create icons for missing images, profiles, logos, etc. assume naive and cheerful characteristics akin to those of fallout vibe - happy, naive, even though a disaster happened. save those prompts in image_prompts.md
- [x] in hall of fame, create a real ranking of evil companies with scores in bathtubs of blood and tears, shipping containers of gold, and such. generate charts of evil "progress"
- [x] generate content for /profiles/ with most notable wrongdoers of the corporate world, give me 20 (created 20 comprehensive profiles: Jamie Dimon, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Lisa Su, Jensen Huang, Arvind Krishna, Bob Iger, Reed Hastings, Daniel Zhang, Mary Barra, Brian Cornell, Gwynne Shotwell, Susan Wojcicki, Sheryl Sandberg, Albert Small Jr.)
- [x] - [x] /institute/ links and /hall of fame/ broken STILL NOT WORKING. WORK HARDER (FIXED: Added proper Jekyll front matter to all Institute and Hall of Fame subpages - they now render correctly)
- [x] create a link to send a cease and desist orders and legal threats. make a form to collect relevant information, but make it super long and complicated with ridiculous amount of things to ask while filing a complaint. sending that form should trigger a public donation campaign to cover the legal costs for the poor defamed capitalists.
- [x] links on http://localhost:4000/Institute/ return 404. I REALLY NEED YOU TO WORK ON THIS.

## PROJECT STATUS UPDATE

- All navigation links should now work properly

**Remaining tasks:** Review any remaining unchecked items in the backlog for additional improvements.
- [ ] organizations still show broken data - some records must be missing data, because part of them shows okay, some dont show
