# Comprehensive Evil Metrics Methodology

## Overview

Building on the success of our **Devil's Metrics** framework for Evil Products, we have developed a comprehensive suite of scoring systems to quantify evil across all aspects of corporate and institutional power. These frameworks provide objective, data-driven assessments of harm that go beyond traditional financial metrics to measure the true cost of corporate behavior on society.

## Framework Portfolio

## Evil Taxonomy Classification System

### Primary Categories
1. **Exploitation** - Worker, consumer, child, forced labor
2. **Violence** - Workplace, product, environmental, state violence
3. **Deception** - Fraud, greenwashing, astroturfing, regulatory fraud
4. **Addiction** - Substance, gambling, technology, debt addiction
5. **Monopolization** - Market, information, infrastructure monopolies
6. **Surveillance** - Employee, consumer, biometric surveillance
7. **Discrimination** - Racial, gender, age, economic discrimination
8. **Destruction** - Environmental, cultural, community destruction

### Application Rules
- Each entity can have multiple taxonomy tags
- Tags help identify patterns across industries
- Enable cross-referencing and comparative analysis
- Support filtering and discovery of related content

## Scoring Methodology

### Base Score Calculation
Each dimension receives a base score (0-max points) based on:
- **Documented evidence** from credible sources
- **Scale of impact** measured in affected population
- **Severity of harm** assessed through standardized criteria
- **Duration and permanence** of damage caused

### Multiplier System

**Intentionality Multipliers (1.0-2.0x)**
- 1.0x: Unintended consequences, negligence
- 1.2x: Willful ignorance, regulatory evasion
- 1.5x: Deliberate harm minimization, active cover-ups
- 2.0x: Intentional addiction/harm design, malicious targeting

**Scale Multipliers (1.0-3.0x)**
- 1.0x: Local/regional impact
- 1.5x: National impact
- 2.0x: International impact
- 3.0x: Global impact with systemic implications

**Vulnerability Multipliers (1.0-2.0x)**
- 1.0x: General population targeting
- 1.3x: Economic exploitation of disadvantaged communities
- 1.7x: Targeting of children, elderly, or marginalized groups
- 2.0x: Exploitation of desperate populations (addiction, medical needs)

### Data Sources and Verification

**Primary Sources**
- Government regulatory filings and investigations
- Court documents and legal proceedings
- Peer-reviewed academic research
- Investigative journalism from credible outlets
- Whistleblower testimonies and leaked documents
- NGO reports and worker advocacy organizations

**Verification Process**
1. **Multi-source confirmation**: Minimum 3 independent sources per major claim
2. **Expert review**: Academic and investigative journalist verification
3. **Regular updates**: Quarterly score adjustments based on new evidence
4. **Transparency**: All scoring rationale and sources publicly documented
5. **Challenge process**: Formal procedure for contesting scores with evidence
