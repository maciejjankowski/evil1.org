            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>1970s-1980s: Agent Orange Legacy</h3>
                <p>Monsanto manufactured Agent Orange for the Vietnam War, knowing it contained dioxin - one of the most toxic substances ever created. The chemical caused birth defects and cancer in millions of Vietnamese civilians and American veterans.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>1990s: Roundup Revolution</h3>
                <p>Introduced glyphosate-based Roundup herbicide as "safe" and "environmentally friendly." Internal documents later revealed Monsanto knew about potential cancer risks but suppressed the information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>2000s: Genetic Domination</h3>
                <p>Developed genetically modified crops resistant to Roundup, creating a monopoly on seed supplies. Farmers became dependent on Monsanto's expensive, patented seeds that couldn't be saved year-to-year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>2010s: Legal Warfare</h3>
                <p>Spent millions suing small farmers for "patent infringement" when their crops were accidentally cross-pollinated with Monsanto's GM seeds. Filed over 140 lawsuits against farmers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>2015: IARC Classification</h3>
                <p>The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic to humans," confirming what Monsanto had known for decades.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>2018: Bayer Acquisition</h3>
                <p>Bayer acquired Monsanto for $63 billion, inheriting thousands of Roundup cancer lawsuits. The acquisition was rushed despite known liabilities.</p>

                    <h3>Roundup Cancer Cover-up</h3>
                    <p>Internal emails showed Monsanto ghostwrote scientific studies and manipulated research to hide glyphosate's cancer risks. Spent $17 million on a "Roundup task force" to discredit critics.</p>

                <div class="crime-card">
                    <h3>PCB Pollution</h3>
                    <p>Dumped millions of pounds of toxic PCBs into rivers and soil. When confronted, Monsanto claimed PCBs were "harmless" despite knowing they caused cancer and birth defects.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="crime-card">
                    <h3>Seed Monopoly</h3>
                    <p>Created "terminator seeds" that produce sterile offspring, forcing farmers to buy new seeds every year. This technology was banned in many countries as a threat to food security.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="crime-card">
                    <h3>Regulatory Capture</h3>
                    <p>Placed former Monsanto executives in key FDA and USDA positions to influence regulations. Michael Taylor served as both Monsanto's lawyer and FDA deputy commissioner.</p>

            <h2>Boardroom Decisions</h2>
            <p>Key decisions by Monsanto's leadership included prioritizing profits over safety, such as suppressing glyphosate's cancer risks and aggressively pursuing patents to dominate the seed market. These decisions led to widespread criticism and legal challenges.</p>

            <h2>Global Impact</h2>
            <p>Monsanto's practices have had a profound impact on global agriculture, including the loss of biodiversity, increased farmer debt, and the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. Developing countries have been disproportionately affected, with small farmers struggling to compete.</p>
