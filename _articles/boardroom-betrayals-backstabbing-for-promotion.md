# Boardroom Betrayals: Backstabbing for Promotion

In the shark-infested waters of corporate boardrooms, betrayal isn't just common - it's the primary currency of advancement. Executives who rise to the top don't do so through competence, innovation, or loyalty. They succeed by stabbing colleagues in the back, undermining rivals, and sacrificing others on the altar of personal ambition. The boardroom is where integrity goes to die and opportunism reigns supreme.

## The Betrayal Hierarchy

### 1. The Information Assassin
**The Tactic**: Stealing credit for others' work
**The Method**: Attending meetings uninvited, then presenting ideas as their own
**The Reward**: Promotions and bonuses for "leadership"
**Examples**:
- **Strategy Sessions**: Taking team ideas to executives
- **Project Presentations**: Claiming authorship of group work
- **Client Meetings**: Positioning as the "key relationship"

### 2. The Saboteur
**The Tactic**: Undermining colleagues to create opportunities
**The Method**: Spreading rumors, withholding information, creating conflicts
**The Reward**: Vacancies created by forced departures
**Examples**:
- **Performance Reviews**: Negative feedback to rivals
- **Resource Allocation**: Denying support to competitors
- **Meeting Exclusion**: Leaving colleagues out of key discussions

### 3. The Corporate Spy
**The Tactic**: Reporting colleagues to superiors
**The Method**: Anonymous tips, exaggerated complaints, selective information
**The Reward**: Favor with powerful executives
**Examples**:
- **Ethics Hotline**: Reporting minor infractions
- **HR Complaints**: Escalating personality conflicts
- **Regulatory Tips**: Selective disclosure of information

### 4. The Alliance Breaker
**The Tactic**: Destroying relationships between colleagues
**The Method**: Sowing discord, creating mistrust, fostering paranoia
**The Reward**: Weakened opposition, easier advancement
**Examples**:
- **Information Leaks**: Revealing confidential discussions
- **False Alliances**: Pretending friendship while plotting
- **Divide and Conquer**: Creating factions within teams

## The Betrayal Playbook

- **Witness Cultivation**: Have allies ready to support your narrative

### Phase 3: The Ascension

- **Relationship Repair**: Mend fences with those you betrayed (selectively)
- **Legacy Building**: Create narrative of your "leadership" during crisis
- **Next Target Identification**: Plan the next betrayal for continued advancement

## The Ultimate Betrayal

Boardroom betrayals reveal the true nature of corporate success: it's not about building great companies or serving customers. It's about climbing over the bodies of colleagues, sacrificing integrity for advancement, and treating human beings as obstacles to personal ambition.

The most successful executive isn't the one who builds the best team - it's the one who destroys the competition most effectively.
