# Devilish Advice Column: How to Survive by Never Telling the Truth

*Dear Readers,*

Welcome to "The Devil's Advocate," your go-to column for practical advice on thriving in corporate America. In a world where honesty is punished and silence is golden, we provide the unvarnished truth about succeeding through strategic dishonesty. Remember: the goal isn't morality - it's survival and advancement.

## Dear Devil's Advocate,

*I'm a mid-level manager at a Fortune 500 company. I discovered that our product has serious safety flaws that could harm customers. Should I report this internally or just keep quiet?*

*- Concerned in Compliance*

### Dear Concerned,

Oh, honey, please. Report it internally? That's adorable. Let me give you the real advice:

**Step 1: Document Nothing**
Delete all emails, notes, and evidence immediately. If you must keep records, store them on a personal device encrypted with your most embarrassing password.

**Step 2: Find Your Angle**
Position yourself as the "solution" to the problem. Volunteer to lead the "remediation team" - this gives you control over the narrative and ensures you're seen as part of the fix, not the problem.

**Step 3: Network Aggressively**
Start building relationships with executives who would be most threatened by this information. Become their confidant. Share "insights" that make you indispensable.

**Step 4: The Plausible Deniability Dance**
If questioned, respond with: "I wasn't aware of the full scope of the issue" or "I trusted the experts on the team." Bonus points if you can blame a subordinate.

**Step 5: Profit from the Crisis**
Use the situation to negotiate a promotion, raise, or transfer to a "safer" department. Remember: crises are career opportunities for the well-positioned.

**The Devil's Bottom Line**: Silence isn't just golden - it's your ticket to the corner office. The people who speak up end up unemployed. The people who stay quiet end up running the company.

## Dear Devil's Advocate,

*My CEO is having an affair with a subordinate. I've seen compromising photos and emails. Should I say something to HR?*

*- Witness to Wrongdoing*

### Dear Witness,

Are you trying to get fired? Let me help you avoid that mistake:

**Step 1: Blackmail is Your Friend**
Don't report it - leverage it. "Accidentally" forward the CEO an email reminding them of your "discretion." Subtle hints about your "photographic memory" work wonders.

**Step 2: Become Indispensable**
Volunteer for high-visibility projects that the CEO cares about. Become the person who "gets things done" without making waves.

**Step 3: Build Your Network**
Cultivate relationships with board members and other executives. Position yourself as a rising star who "understands the business."

**Step 4: The Art of Selective Blindness**
Practice the corporate art of "not seeing what you don't want to see." Focus on your work while maintaining plausible deniability.

**Step 5: Cash In**
Use your newfound leverage for promotions, bonuses, or choice assignments. Remember: knowledge is power, but applied knowledge is advancement.

**The Devil's Bottom Line**: Why be a whistleblower when you can be a kingmaker? The people who expose affairs get fired. The people who profit from secrets get promoted.

## Dear Devil's Advocate,

*Our company is polluting a local river, and I have evidence. The EPA is investigating. Should I cooperate with regulators?*

*- Environmentally Aware*

### Dear Aware,

Cooperate with regulators? That's career suicide! Here's how to survive and thrive:

**Step 1: Control the Narrative**
Before regulators contact you, "discover" the issue yourself. Lead an "internal investigation" that "uncovers" the problem on your terms.

**Step 2: Become the Face of Compliance**
Volunteer to be the company's point person with regulators. This gives you control over what information is shared and how it's presented.

**Step 3: Document Selectively**
Create records that show you "raised concerns" internally while omitting any evidence that could be damaging. Focus on "remediation efforts" rather than violations.

**Step 4: Build Alliances**
Cultivate relationships with lawyers, consultants, and executives who benefit from the status quo. Become known as a "practical problem-solver."

**Step 5: Profit from the Cleanup**
Position yourself to lead environmental initiatives, diversity programs, or other corporate social responsibility efforts. These are great for your resume and often come with bonuses.

**The Devil's Bottom Line**: Whistleblowers end up unemployed and sued. Compliance leaders end up with corner offices and stock options. Choose wisely.

## Dear Devil's Advocate,

*I've been asked to falsify sales numbers to meet quarterly targets. What should I do?*

*- Numbers Guy*

### Dear Numbers,

Finally, a question with some real potential! Here's how to turn this into a career booster:

**Step 1: Master the Art of Creative Accounting**
Don't just falsify - excel at it. Learn the techniques that won't get caught immediately. Become the "numbers wizard" everyone relies on.

**Step 2: Protect Yourself**
Create an audit trail that points elsewhere if things go wrong. Use subordinates or external vendors as buffers.

**Step 3: Build Your Power Base**
Use your ability to "make the numbers work" to build alliances with sales managers and executives. Become indispensable to quota attainment.

**Step 4: The Promotion Path**
Volunteer for "stretch assignments" that require "creative solutions." Position yourself as someone who "gets results" rather than someone who follows rules.

**Step 5: Exit Strategy**
Once you've built your network and resume, start looking for opportunities at companies that value your "skills." The corporate world always needs people who can "move numbers."

**The Devil's Bottom Line**: Accountants who follow rules get fired. Accountants who make executives look good get promoted to CFO.

## Dear Devil's Advocate,

*My company is discriminating against certain employees. I have documentation. Should I file a complaint?*

*- Justice Seeker*

### Dear Seeker,

File a complaint? That's the fast track to unemployment. Here's the smart approach:

**Step 1: Assess the Power Dynamics**
Identify who benefits from the status quo and who would be threatened by change. Align yourself with the beneficiaries.

**Step 2: Become the Diversity Champion**
Volunteer to lead diversity initiatives, training programs, and employee resource groups. This gives you credibility without threatening anyone.

**Step 3: Document Strategically**
Keep records that show you're "advocating for change" while not actually rocking the boat. Focus on "incremental improvements" rather than systemic reform.

**Step 4: Network with Decision Makers**
Build relationships with HR executives and board members. Become known as someone who "understands the business realities."

**Step 5: Cash In**
Use your "diversity expertise" to negotiate promotions, speaking engagements, or consulting opportunities. It's great for your personal brand.

**The Devil's Bottom Line**: Activists get fired and blacklisted. Diversity consultants get promoted and well-paid. The difference is knowing when to push and when to posture.

## The Devil's Final Word

Remember, dear readers: corporate America isn't about right and wrong - it's about winning. The people who tell the truth end up unemployed, sued, and shamed. The people who play the game end up wealthy, powerful, and admired.

Honesty is for losers. Strategic dishonesty is how you climb the corporate ladder. Choose your path wisely.

*Until next time,*
*The Devil's Advocate*
