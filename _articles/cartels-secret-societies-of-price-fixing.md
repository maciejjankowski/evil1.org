# Cartels: Secret Societies of Price Fixing

Cartels are the secret societies of the corporate world, where supposed competitors meet in smoke-filled rooms (or encrypted chat rooms) to fix prices, rig bids, and divide markets. They don't compete - they collude. They don't innovate - they conspire. They don't serve consumers - they exploit them. Cartels are organized crime in business suits, stealing billions while maintaining the facade of free market competition.

## The Cartel Conspiracy

### Price Fixing 101
Cartels don't set prices through market forces - they set them through secret agreements:
- **Minimum Prices**: Agreeing not to go below certain levels
- **Price Increases**: Coordinating simultaneous price hikes
- **Discount Restrictions**: Limiting promotional pricing
- **Customer Allocation**: Dividing customers among members

### Bid Rigging
In procurement processes, cartels rig the outcomes:
- **Bid Rotation**: Taking turns winning contracts
- **Cover Bids**: Submitting fake high bids to make winning bid look competitive
- **Bid Suppression**: Agreeing not to bid against each other
- **Subcontracting**: Dividing work among cartel members

### Market Division
Cartels carve up territories like colonial powers:
- **Geographic Division**: Each member gets exclusive territories
- **Customer Division**: Allocating specific customers to members
- **Product Division**: Specializing in different product lines
- **Time Division**: Taking turns in different time periods

## The Cartel Methods

Cartels are the ultimate betrayal of free market principles. They pretend to compete while secretly colluding to steal from consumers. They undermine innovation, reduce quality, and distort markets for their benefit.

The cartel mentality - that cooperation is better than competition - is the antithesis of capitalism. It's organized crime masquerading as business. It's theft on an industrial scale.

Fighting cartels requires not just better enforcement, but a fundamental commitment to competition. Consumers must demand transparency, governments must impose real penalties, and corporations must be held accountable.

Only when cartels face true consequences will markets truly serve consumers rather than conspirators.
