## Instacart's War on Transparency: A Blackwood & Finch Special

When the online group Jobs.now started exposing "ghost jobs" at major tech companies, most corporations grumbled and paid their fines. But Instacart, ever the innovator, decided to go on the offensive.

Their weapon of choice? A cease-and-desist letter, likely drafted by a firm with the moral flexibility of Blackwood & Finch.

### The Legal Argument: A Masterpiece of Absurdity

The letter's central claim is that the public sharing of job openings constitutes a "misappropriation and violation of the rights of Instacart."

Let that sink in. A company is claiming that you, a member of the public, do not have the right to see or share a job opening that is, by definition, public. It's a legal argument so audacious, so brazenly anti-common sense, that it could only have been conceived in the hallowed halls of a firm like Blackwood & Finch.

### The True Goal: Intimidation

The letter is not meant to be won in court; it's meant to intimidate. By threatening a small, volunteer-run group with the specter of "monetary compensation" for the "damages" of receiving too many applications from qualified Americans, Instacart is sending a clear message: "Stop telling people we're hiring."

It's a classic SLAPP suit tactic, designed to silence critics through financial and legal pressure. And it's a stark reminder that for some companies, the only thing worse than a job opening is a qualified American applying for it.
