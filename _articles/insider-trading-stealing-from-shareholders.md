# Insider Trading: Stealing from Shareholders

In the casino of Wall Street, some players have loaded dice. Corporate insiders - executives, directors, and major shareholders - use confidential information to trade stocks before the public knows crucial facts. The result? Billions stolen from ordinary investors, market manipulation that undermines trust, and a system where the rich get richer by stealing from the less sophisticated.

## The Insider Trading Machine

**The Method**: Board meetings, earnings calls, strategic planning

**The Strategy**: Trading before major announcements
**The Method**: Buying low before good news, selling high before bad news
**The Benefit**: Guaranteed profits from market reactions

## The Ultimate Betrayal

Insider trading isn't just illegal - it's theft. Corporate insiders steal from their own shareholders, using confidential information to enrich themselves at the expense of ordinary investors. They betray the trust placed in them by employees, customers, and the public.

The stock market was supposed to be a level playing field where anyone could participate and succeed. Instead, it's a rigged game where the connected few profit at the expense of everyone else.

Every insider trade is a violation of fiduciary duty, a betrayal of trust, and a theft from those who believe in the system. The insiders don't just break the law - they break the social contract that makes markets possible.
