## Ghost Jobs: The Booming Industry of Pretending to Hire

Have you ever applied for a job online, only to have your application disappear into a black hole? Congratulations, you may have encountered a "ghost job"—a job posting that isn't meant for you, or for any American, for that matter.

### The Scheme Explained

The Immigration Act of 1990, in its infinite wisdom, created the H-1B visa program to attract "exceptionally talented people." To convert these temporary workers into permanent residents, a company must first "prove" that it couldn't find a qualified American for the job.

And how does a multi-billion dollar corporation "prove" this? By "advertising" the job in the most obscure, inconvenient, and applicant-repellent way possible.

### Tactics of the Trade

*   **The Postal Service Gambit:** Requiring software engineers in 2025 to submit their applications via snail mail. The modern equivalent of sending a raven.
*   **The Email Black Hole:** Creating a dedicated email address like `Immigration.Applications@megacorp.com` that goes directly to a folder that is never opened.
*   **The Impossible Job Description:** Requiring 10 years of experience in a programming language that was invented 5 years ago.

This isn't a bug in the system; it's a feature. It allows companies to maintain a pipeline of cheaper, more compliant labor while maintaining the fiction of a fair hiring process. So next time you see a job posting that looks too good to be true, it probably is. It's already been filled—by someone who is just waiting for the "search" to be over.
