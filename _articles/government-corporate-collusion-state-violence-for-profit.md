# Government-Corporate Collusion: State Violence for Profit

When corporations can't handle opposition through legal means, they call in the ultimate enforcer: the state. Governments worldwide have repeatedly used intelligence agencies, military forces, and covert operations to protect corporate interests, eliminate environmental activists, and ensure that business profits flow uninterrupted. This is the dark alliance between state power and corporate greed.

## The Rainbow Warrior Bombing: France Terrorizes for Nuclear Profits

### The Attack
On July 10, 1985, French intelligence agents bombed the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbor, New Zealand, killing photographer Fernando Pereira. The ship was preparing to protest French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

### The Corporate Connection
- **Nuclear Industry Interests**: French nuclear program worth billions in weapons and energy
- **Corporate Partners**: French nuclear companies Areva, EDF, and weapons manufacturers

- **Real Motive**: Protecting nuclear industry profits from environmental opposition

### The Cover-Up
- **Initial Denial**: French government claimed no involvement
- **Media Manipulation**: Blamed "foreign terrorists" and "environmental extremists"
- **International Pressure**: Only admitted involvement when evidence became overwhelming
- **Light Sentences**: Agents served minimal time, treated as heroes upon return

## The Ultimate Corporate Protection Racket

The alliance between corporations and state violence represents the ultimate protection racket. Businesses pay taxes and campaign contributions, and in return, governments provide military protection, intelligence services, and the willingness to kill anyone who threatens corporate profits.

This is not capitalism—it's fascism. When the state becomes the enforcement arm of corporate power, democracy dies, human rights disappear, and violence becomes the primary tool of economic policy.

The Rainbow Warrior bombing was not an aberration—it was a perfect example of how far governments will go to protect corporate interests. As environmental and social crises intensify, we can expect this partnership between state terror and corporate greed to escalate.

The only question is whether humanity will wake up to this threat before it's too late.
